        "on 2014\nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography \nCHAPTER 2 GEOMORPHOLOGY  27\nChapter\n2\nRiver discharge\nThe amount of water flowing out of a river shows many aspects of a river. \nOne way to study this discharge or runoff is by looking at a flow hydrograph.\nWhen runoff enters a river, the amount of water flowing in the river \nincreases. A hydrograph records how quickly the water level increases \n(time) and how high the water level reaches (peak flow discharge). \nA flow hydrograph combines two graphs:\nâ¢ \nA bar graph showing the amount of precipitation\nâ¢ \nA line graph showing how the water level increases and decreases \nover time\nFigure 2.2.1B below shows an example of a flow hydrograph. Study the \ngraph and then read the explanation alongside.\nExplanation of the elements in Figure 2.2.2B(left):\n1. The line graph shows the volume of the river over \ntime. The horizontal axis shows time in hours and \nthe vertical axis shows runoff in cubic metres per \nsecond (m3/sec).\n2. The rising segment shows the rate at which \nthe water in the river is increasing. It is steep if \ninfiltration is rapid. It is gentle if infiltration is slow \nas water takes longer to reach the river.\nâ¢ Urban areas have a rapid rising segment as \nthe water reaches the river quickly.\nâ¢ Naturally vegetated areas allow for \ninfiltration and the rising segment is less \nsteep.\n3. The falling segment shows the rate at which the \nwater in the river is decreasing.
