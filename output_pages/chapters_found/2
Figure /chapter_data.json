This movement of people \nfrom a rural area to an urban area is called rural-urban migration.\nIn this section we look at the factors that cause people to leave the rural \nareas (push factors) and move to the urban areas (pull factors). We will \nalso look at what governments do to keep people in the rural areas.\nPush and pull factors causing people  \nto leave the rural areas\nTable 3.2 below summarises the factors that make people want to leave \nthe rural areas and move to cities.\nMake sure  \nyou understand the \ndifference between \npush and pull  \nfactors.\nPush factors\nRemember, these make you  \nwant to leave rural areas.  \nThey push you away.\nPull factors\nRemember, these make you  \nwant to move to urban areas.  \nThey pull you in.\nNatural disasters, such as drought or floods, have a \ngreater impact in rural areas.\nNatural disasters have a smaller impact; government \nprovides more help to urban areas during droughts \nand floods.\nLack of facilities in rural areas, e.g. fewer schools, \ncolleges or universities, and fewer hospitals or clinics in \nrural areas\nBetter and more access to education and medical \nfacilities in urban areas"
