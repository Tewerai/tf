    "de 12 Geography \nCHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY OF SOUTH AFRICA  87\nChapter\n4\nFactors favouring (promoting) industrial \ndevelopment in South Africa\nThese factors make industries more productive and more profitable:\n• \nSouth Africa has a wide range of industries because there is a wide \nrange of raw materials to support production.\n• \nA well-developed infrastructure (roads and railway lines, water and \nelectricity) assists industries to do business. \n• \nThe availability of cheap, level (flat) land makes it cheaper to develop \nindustries in South Africa.\n• \nThe availability of a large skilled and unskilled labour force in the \nareas where industries are located decreases the costs of training \nand worker accommodation and transport.\nFactors hindering (restricting/limiting) \nindustrial development in South Africa\nThese factors make industries less productive and less profitable:\n• \nThe large distances between South Africa and its foreign markets \nincrease transport costs and make it more difficult to compete with \nindustries in those countries.\n• \nThere is a shortage of skilled labour in South Africa. This increases \nlabour costs because industries have to attract foreign skilled labour \nand pay high salaries to retain skilled workers.\n• \nLabour strikes decrease the productivity of industries in South  \nAfrica and this increases costs and limits further industrial \ndevelopment.\n• \nWater and electricity shortages and price increases limit further \nindustrial development.\nImportance of industrial development in \nSouth Africa\n• \nWhen we export processed goods we earn more foreign exchange \nthan if we exported the raw material.\n• \nIndustries provide more and higher paid employment to the \npopulation, this in turn leads to an increase in the standard of living \nof the population. This increases their buying power which further \nstimulates industrial development. It also increases the money made \nfrom rates and taxes, so the government has more money to spend  \non improving infrastructure and other facilities.\n• \nThe employment of people in industries leads to the development of \nmore skills and experience; this in turn leads to the development of \nnew technology.\n• \nIndustrial growth stimulates the development of all other services  \nand facilities.\nMain industrial regions in South Africa\nFigure 4.2.1A on page 88 shows the four main industrial regions in South \nAfrica."
