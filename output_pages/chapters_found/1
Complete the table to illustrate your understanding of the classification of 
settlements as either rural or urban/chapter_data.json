Figure 3.2.A illustrates a \nrural settlement.\nLand use in rural settlements\nThe largest land use in South Africa is agriculture. Approximately 12, 1% of \nthe land is used for both commercial and subsistence cultivation of crops.\nAlthough rural communities focus on primary economic activities (farming \nand forestry), there are a number of different ways in which the land in \nthese settlements can be used.\nSubsistence farming involves using the land to grow crops and breed \nanimals that are a source of food for the family living on the farm. The aim \nis not to sell the goods, but to consume them.\nCommercial farming is practised where the land is used to grow crops or \nbreed animals that are then sold as food sources to other markets. The \nmain aim of this rural land use is to generate income for the farmers. \nCommercial farming can be either intensive or extensive.\nCommercial farming can be divided into:\n• \nStock farming: Animals, for example, cows, chicken, sheep, pigs.\n• \nCrop farming: Cultivation of land, for example, maize, wheat, fruit, \nvegetables.\n• \nMixed farming: A combination of stock and crop farming.\nYou need to  \nknow how to  \nidentify stock and  \ncrop farming on  \na map."
