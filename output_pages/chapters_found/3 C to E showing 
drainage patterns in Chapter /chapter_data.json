    "ap CAPS Grade 12 Geography \nCHAPTER 5 MAPWORK  135\nChapter\n5\n5.4.2 Geomorphology\nIn the exam, you may be asked questions such as:\n1. In which direction does the river flow?\nDetermine the height of the river at each point where it starts and ends \non the map. A river flows downhill, so it flows from the highest point to the \nlowest point.\nLook at the tributaries that join the main river. The direction in which tributaries join \nthe main river follows the same direction in which the river is flowing.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\n2. Identify the drainage pattern of the river.\nDetermine the pattern of the river system. Is it a dendritic, radial or trellis \npattern? Refer to Figure 2.2.3 C to E on page 31 showing drainage patterns \nin Chapter 2: Geomorphology.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\n3. Determine the underlying rock structure of an area.\nDetermine the drainage pattern in the area. The causes of a drainage \npattern tell you the kind of rock in the area. For example, if there is \na dendritic drainage then the underlying rocks are either horizontal \nsedimentary rock, igneous or metamorphic rock. Refer to Figure 2.2.3 C to E showing \ndrainage patterns in Chapter 2: Geomorphology.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\n4. In which stage (course) is the river?\nDetermine the steepness of the sides of the valley and the steepness of \nthe river course. A very steep valley is V-shaped and has a steep gradient. \nThis is where the upper course of a river is found. In contrast, if you find a \nwide floodplain (flat area alongside a river), meanders, marshes or vleis, and oxbow \nlakes, this is where the lower course of a river is found.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams"
