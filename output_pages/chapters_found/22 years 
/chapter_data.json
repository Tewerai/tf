Look at the following example: \nMD = 20° 10’ W – 44’ E \nBefore you can subtract the mean annual change of 44’ E from the given magnetic \ndeclination, you need to borrow 1° from 20° and convert it to minutes. This leaves you \nwith 19°. Now take the 1° and convert it to 60’ (remember that 1° = 60’). Now add the \n60’ to the 10’. This gives you 70’. Now you can continue with the calculation:\n19° 70’ – 44’ E = 19° 26’ W\nNow look at the following worked example:\nMean magnetic declination (MD) 25º 32’ west of true north (1986.04)\nMean annual change (AC) 2’ eastwards (1983–1992)\nMD\nTN\nMN"
