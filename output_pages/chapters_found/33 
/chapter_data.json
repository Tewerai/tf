    "partment of Basic Education 2014\n138  CHAPTER 5 MAPWORK \nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n5\n Activity 5.9\nRefer to the topographic map 2530BD Nelspruit and the orthophoto map \nextract at the back of this study guide to answer the following questions.\n1. Underline the correct term that matches the description below:\na) Data that refers to the actual position of an object is  \nvector/raster data. \n(1 × 2 = 2)\nb) Data that is stored in pixels is vector/raster data. \n(1 × 2 = 2)\n2. Refer to block B1 on the 2530BD Nelspruit topographic  \nmap. Give an example from this block of the following:\na) Point feature \n(1 × 2 = 2)\nb) Line feature \n(1 × 2 = 2)\nc) Polygon feature \n(1 × 2 = 2)\n3. List any four layers that were used to draw this  \ntopographic map. \n(4 × 2 = 8)\n[18]\nAnswers to activity 5.9\n1. a) Data that refers to the actual position of an object is vector3/ \n \nraster data. \n(2)\nb) Data that is stored in pixels is vector/raster3 data. \n(2)\n2. a) Point feature: spot height3/farmstead3/tree3 \n(any 1) (2)\nb) Line feature: contour3/power line3/track or hiking trail3/ \nroad3/dam wall3/river (perennial or non- perennial)3/ \nfurrow3 \n(any 1) (2)\nc) Polygon feature: woodland3/cultivated land3/orchards3/\nexcavations3 \n(any 1) (2)\n3. The following layers were used to draw the topographic map:\n• \nWoodland – all the farming land and woodland areas33\n• \nHeight – the brown contour lines33\n• \nWater – all the rivers and the perennial water and furrows33\n• \nTransport – roads and track/hiking trail33 \n(8)\n[18]\nNow that \nyou have studied the \nconcepts that relate \nto GIS, you can do the \nfollowing activity.\nYou are \nthere, well \ndone!"
