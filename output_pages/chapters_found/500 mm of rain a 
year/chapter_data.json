There \nare different types of farming: crop farming, stock farming and mixed \nfarming (both crop and stock). The word ‘agriculture’ is used to refer to all \ntypes of farming. Firstly, pay attention to Table 4.1, where the differences \nbetween a large scale farmer and small scale farmer are explained.\nTable 4.1 The differences between a large scale farmer and a small scale farmer\nSmall scale farmer\nLarge scale farmer\n• Farmers with limited resources\n• Hobby farmers, retirement farmers, lifestyle farmers\n• Those who sell directly to consumers — through farmers markets, CSAs \nand other marketing channels which are not part of the traditional, \nwholesale distribution chain\n• Those who grow vegetables or fruits while also raising livestock\nThe modern trend to enlarge \nfarms to reach optimal size as a \nbusiness enterprise rather than as \na unit size suited to single family \nmanagement.\nFactors favouring (promoting) farming\nThese factors make farming more productive and profitable:\n• \nThere is a high demand (market) for farming products so farmers  \nsell their crops more easily. Farmers’ profits rise when they can sell \nfor a higher price to overseas markets with a demand for their crops \nor stock.\n• \nThe fertile floodplains of rivers allow farmers to produce more crops \nor grazing land (pastures) in these areas. This supports farming and \nincreases profits.\n• \nThe eastern half of the country gets more than 500 mm of rain a \nyear. This makes it possible to produce more crops and ensures \ngreener pastures for stock farming, therefore increasing profits.\n• \nThe relatively high summer temperatures help crops to grow and \nincrease crop production. It also ensures greener pastures for  \nstock farming.\n• \nAvailability of labour (workers)\nFactors hindering (restrict/limit) farming\nThese factors make farming difficult and therefore less productive and \nless profitable:\n• \nRainfall is low and unreliable on the plateau, which limits crop \nproduction and decreases available pastures for stock farming.\n• \nSoil erosion due to incorrect farming methods increases farming \ncosts and decreases profits.\n• \nNatural hazards such as droughts, floods and hail storms damage \ncrops and stock and decrease production and profits.\n• \nHIV and AIDS have a negative impact on the health and productivity \nof farm workers.\n• \nPrice fluctuations (when prices go up and down) make it difficult for \nfarmers to stay in business and make a profit.\n• \nPests which affect crops and stock are costly to control and cause a \ndecrease in production and profits.\nUse the following word \nmnemonic to help you \nremember the factors that \nfavour farming in South Africa:\nF = Fertility \nÒ Farmer\nD = Demand \nÒ Daniel\nR = Rain \nÒ Reaps\nT = Temperatures Ò Tomatoes\nUse the following word \nmnemonic to help you remember \nthe factors that hinder farming in \nSouth Africa:\nH = Hazards Ò \nHungry\nP = Price \nÒ \nPeople\nS = Soil \nÒ \nSeek\nH = Health \nÒ \nHealthy\nR = Rainfall Ò \nRound\nP = Pests \nÒ \nPotatoes"
