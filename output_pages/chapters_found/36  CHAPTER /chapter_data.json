When \nrejuvenation occurs, there is a sudden drop \nin the profile, causing the profile to no longer \nbe concave. The profile is now an ungraded \nprofile. The sudden drop in the profile is \ncalled a knickpoint. Rejuvenation can occur \nmore than once along a river’s profile forming \nknickpoints along the way. Figure 2.2.5E \n(left) shows a graded (concave) longitudinal \nprofile of a river before rejuvenation. Figure \n2.2.5F (left) shows an ungraded (not \nconcave) longitudinal profile of a river after \nrejuvenation.\nThe river wants to regain its concave profile \nso it will erode the knickpoints, making them \nless visible over time.\nRiver capture\nA river is rejuvenated when it gets more energy. A river which has more \nenergy can lead to more erosion, especially headward erosion. Headward \nerosion is when the source of a river erodes backwards towards the \nwatershed. The headward erosion eventually leads to the river capturing \nthe water of another river. River capture is sometimes called river piracy. \nThis is because one river ‘robs’ another river of its water.\nHeadward erosion occurs because a river has more energy. Reasons for \nthe increased energy are:\n• \nA river flowing over a steeper gradient will flow faster\n• \nA river with a larger volume will flow faster\n• \nA river flowing over less resistant rock will flow faster \nIn Figures 2.2.5G and H (see page 37) you can see how river A erodes back \n(headward erosion) towards river B. River A ‘captures’ extra water from \nriver B. River A is rejuvenated. \nStudy Figures 2.2.5I and J (see page 37) of stream capture and note the \ndifferent features formed as a result of river capture.\nFigure 2.2.6E: Graded longitudinal profile of a river before \nrejuvenation\nFigure 2.2.5F: Ungraded longitudinal profile of a river after \nrejuvenation\nSource\nMouth\nSource\nKnickpoint\nKnickpoint\nKnickpoints and incised valley \nsections retreat upstream\nA graded  \nprofile has no \nkickpoint, it is a \nsmooth concave slope. \nAn ungraded profile \nhas one or more \nkickpoints\nYou may be asked in an exam to identify if rejuvenation has \noccurred. Knickpoints occur during rejuvenation. After rejuvenation, \nknickpoints wear away, making the profile smooth once again (graded).\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams"
