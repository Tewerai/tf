    "climate)\nValley climate occurs on a local scale and lasts for a few hours. In this \nsection we will focus on:\n• \nAnabatic and katabatic winds\n• \nAspect\n1.4.1 Anabatic and katabatic winds\nThe structure of a valley and the heating and cooling that occurs during  \na day cause anabatic and katabatic winds to occur. This is shown in \nFigures 1.4.1A and 1.4.1B.\nFigure 1.4.1A: Anabatic winds \n                                     Figure 1.4.1B: Katabatic winds\nAirflow\nDuring the day, \nthe slopes and \nair above them \nare heated\nWarm, less \ndense air rises \nup the valley \nsides, forming \nanabatic winds\nAnabatic winds (day)\nKatabatic winds (night)\nEffect of anabatic winds on settlements\n• \nAnabatic winds take pollution out of the valley.\nEffects of katabatic winds on settlements\n• \nKatabatic winds trap pollution in the valley.\n• \nKatabatic winds bring cold temperatures to the valley.\nKatabatic winds lead to the development of the thermal belt (zone of \nwarmer temperature above the valley floor) and a frost pocket (an area of \nvery cold temperatures at the bottom of a valley where frost occurs) in a \nvalley at night. This is shown in Figure 1.4.1C.\nAt night, the \nslopes and air \nabove them \nare cooled\nCold, dense \nair subsides \ndown the valley \nslopes forming \nkatabatic \nwinds\nwarm thermal belt\nAnabatic means  \n‘moving upward’ and \nkatabatic means  \n‘going downhill’.\n In the exam, you may be asked to draw, label or describe how \nanabatic or katabatic winds form in valleys. Learn to redraw and \nlabel Figures 1.4.1A and 1.4.1B below.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams"
