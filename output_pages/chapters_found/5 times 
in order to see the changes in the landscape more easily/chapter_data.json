    "eography \nCHAPTER 5 MAPWORK  129\nChapter\n5\nMethod for calculating vertical \nexaggeration\nFollow these steps:\nStep 1:  Change the vertical scale from a word scale to a number \nscale. The vertical scale will be given to you in the question,  \ne.g. 1 cm = 40 m. \n \nYou must have the same units on both sides of the vertical scale \nin order to write it as a number scale. We need to convert 40 m \ninto cm. To do this you multiply the 40 m by 100 (1 m = 100 cm). \nOur scale becomes 1 cm = 4 000 cm or     1    \n4 000.\nStep 2: The horizontal scale is already written as a number scale. On a \ntopographic map the scale is 1:50 000 and on an orthophoto \nthe scale is 1:10 000.\nStep 3: Write both scales as fractions and divide the vertical scale by the \nhorizontal scale:\n \nVE =     1    ÷      1     \n \n \n4000  50 000\nStep 4: Now ‘tip and times’ the two fractions. You do this by swopping \nthe top and bottom numbers of the horizontal scale fraction and \nthen multiplying the top of each fraction together and the bottom \nof each fraction together.\n \nVE =     1    × 50 000\n \n \n4000       1     \nStep 5: You are now left with one fraction. Divide the top by the bottom. \n(Use your calculator to divide 50 000 by 4 000.)\n \nVE = 50 000\n \n \n 4 000 \nAn easy way to remember that the horizontal scale goes on top is that \n‘H’ comes before ‘V’ in the alphabet.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\nexams\nStep 6:  Write the answer as follows:\n \nVE = 12,5 times\n \nThis means the cross section has been exaggerated 12,5 times \nin order to see the changes in the landscape more easily."
