Some of the \nnegative effects of mining are:\n• \nThe natural vegetation is removed to clear the ground for mining \nactivities. This leads to an increase in soil erosion in these areas.\n• \nWhen vegetation is removed it destroys natural habitats and \ndamages ecosystems, which can lead to the extinction of plants and \nanimals in the area.\n• \nThe land is destroyed when mine dumps and slimes dams are built \nto store waste.\n• \nChemicals that leach (wash off) from the mine dumps when it rains \ncause water and land pollution.\n• \nSinkholes are a danger in areas where mining takes place. \n• \nCoal is a major mining product in South Africa. Power stations burn \ncoal to make electricity. The carbon dioxide that is released during \nthis process contributes to global warming and climate change.\n4.2 Secondary economic \nactivities\nSecondary activities involve the processing of raw materials and \nmanufacturing of goods. We use the word ‘industries’ for secondary \nactivities. For example, sugar cane is turned into sugar at an industry \ncalled a sugar refinery; trees are turned into wood shavings and then \npaper at an industry called a sawmill; cowhides are turned into leather to \nmake handbags and shoes at an industry called a tannery.\nSecondary activities can be divided into heavy and light industries. Learn \nthe information in Table 4.2 below to understand the differences between \nthese two types of industries.\nLight industry\nHeavy industry\nExample\nJewellery making, clothes factory, \ncomputer manufacturer, food and \nbeverages\nPower stations, iron and steel factory, \nmotor vehicle factory, paper mill\nLocation \nIn a city in the CBD; in the zone of decay; \nin an industrial estate\nOn the outskirts of a city; in rural areas \nnear the raw material source\nRaw material\nSmall, may be partially processed\nLarge, bulk, not processed\nLand requirements\nNo specific needs, may be in a multi-\nstorey building\nNeeds a large area of flat land, single-\nstorey buildings\nInfrastructure\nUses existing road network and local \npower supply\nNeeds access to major roads or railways, \nwater supply and power supply\nEnvironmental impact\nHas little to no impact on the surrounding \narea\nUtilises a large amount of water and \ncauses air and noise pollution\nTable 4.2: The differences between heavy and light industries\nIn an exam you may be asked \nto identify a heavy or light \nindustry from a picture or \non a topographic map. You \nmay also be asked to state \nthe characteristics of heavy \nor light industries. Learn \nthe information in Table 4.2 \nto help you answer these \nquestions.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\nIn an exam you may be asked \nto state the factors that favour \nor hinder mining.
