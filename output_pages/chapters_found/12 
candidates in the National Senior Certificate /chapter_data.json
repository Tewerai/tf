    "tion has pleasure in releasing the second \nedition of Mind the Gap study guides for Grade 12 learners. These study \nguides continue the  innovative and committed attempt by the Department \nof Basic Education to improve the academic performance of Grade 12 \ncandidates in the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examination.\nThe study guides have been written by subject expert teams comprised \nof teachers, examiners, moderators, subject advisors and subject co-\nordinators. Research started in 2012 shows that the Mind the Gap series \nhas, without doubt, had a positive impact in improving grades. It is my \nfervent wish that the Mind the Gap study guides take us all closer towards \nensuring that no learner is left behind, especially as we move forward in \nour celebration of 20 years of democracy.\nThe second edition of Mind the Gap is aligned to the 2014 Curriculum and \nAssessment Policy Statement (CAPS). This means that the writers have \nconsidered the National Policy pertaining to the programme, promotion \nrequirements and protocol for assessment of the National Curriculum \nStatement for Grade 12 in 2014.\nThe Mind the Gap CAPS study guides take their brief in part from the 2013 \nNational Diagnostic report on learner performance and draws on the \n2014 Grade 12 Examination Guidelines. Each of the Mind the Gap study \nguides provides explanations of key terminology, simple explanations and \nexamples of the types of questions that learners can expect to be asked in \nan exam. Marking memoranda are included to assist learners in building \ntheir understanding. Learners are also referred to specific questions in \npast national exam papers and examination memos that are available on \nthe Department’s website – www.education.gov.za.\nThe CAPS edition include Accounting, Economics, Geography, Life \nSciences, Mathematics, Mathematical Literacy and Physical Sciences. \nThe series is produced in both English and Afrikaans. There are also  \nnine English First  Additional Language study guides. They include EFAL \nPaper 1 (Language); EFAL Paper 3 (Writing); and a study guide for each of \nthe  Grade 12 prescribed literature set works.\nThe study guides have been designed to  assist those learners who \nhave been underperforming due to a lack of exposure to the content \nrequirements of the curriculum and aims to mind-the-gap between failing \nand passing, by bridging the gap in learners’ understanding of commonly \ntested concepts so candidates can pass.\nAll that is now required is for our Grade 12 learners to put in the hours \npreparing for the examinations. Learners make us proud – study hard. We \nwish each and every one of you good luck for your Grade 12 examinations.\n_________________________________\nMatsie Angelina Motshekga, MP\nMinister of Basic Education\nMay 2014\n© Department of Basic Education 2014\nMatsie Angelina Motshekga, MP\nMinister of Basic Education"
