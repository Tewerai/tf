Distance = 6,8 cm 3× 0,53 = 3,4 km3  \n(3)\n[6]\n Activity 5.2\nCalculate the following distances which are shown on an orthophoto.\n■ P\n1. Calculate the distance from the post office to the dipping tank in \nmetres. \n(3)\n2. Calculate the distance along the track in kilometres. \n(3)\n[6]\nAnswers to activity 5.2\n1. Distance = 6,6 cm3 × 1003 = 660 m3 \n(3)\n2. Distance = 5,4 cm3 × 0,13 =0,54 km3 \n(3)\n[6]\nArea \nArea is the amount of surface a two-dimensional shape covers. (A two-\ndimensional shape has length and breadth.)\nWe calculate area to find out how much land is covered (e.g. by a maize \nfield) or how much space we have to build on.\nFormula for area\nArea = Length × Breadth\nA = L × B\nMethod for calculating area \nFollow these steps:\nStep 1: Measure the length in cm and convert to km or m.\nStep 2: Measure the breadth in cm and convert to km or m.\nStep 3: Apply the formula A = L × B.\nStep 4:  Write the answer in kilometres squared (km²) or metres  \nsquared (m²)."
