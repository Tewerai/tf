The layout or arrangement \nof the roads is called the street pattern. In this section we focus on four \nstreet patterns:\n• \nGridiron \n• \nRadial \n• \nPlanned irregular \n• \nUnplanned irregular \nStudy Figures 3.3.3A to D to G (below and on page 58) to understand the \nfour street patterns.\nGridiron street pattern\n• The roads intersect at right angles, forming rectangular blocks.\n• Found in the CBD and older cities\nAdvantages of the gridiron street pattern\n• Easy to find way around (cannot get lost)\n• Land can be divided up easily\n• Can be converted into one-way streets to ease traffic congestion\n• Shorter distance to travel\n• Little wastage of land\nDisadvantages of the gridiron street pattern\n• Traffic congestion as traffic stops at every intersection\n• More accidents because of intersections\n• Monotonous (boring) suburb layout\nFigure 3.3.3D: Gridiron street pattern\nland value"
