Food that is supplied locally is less expensive than \nimported food.\n• \nFarming equipment is expensive because much of it is imported, \nbut South Africa has reduced these costs by manufacturing some \nequipment locally, for example irrigation systems.\n• \nFarming involves moving crops to the markets, which in turn leads \nto improving the country’s infrastructure (roads, railways and \ncommunication systems).\n• \nSouth African farming products are exported to other countries \nearning us foreign exchange. This improves the country’s economy.\nFood security and insecurity\nFood security is when all the people have enough food to meet their needs \nfor a healthy and productive life. Some of the factors (reasons) why people \nhave enough food (food security) are:\n• \nCommercial farms are able to produce enough food due to \nfavourable climatic factors.\n• \nPeople can afford to buy the food. In other words, farmers have a \nmarket. \n• \nThe need to import food from other countries at high costs is \nreduced because food is grown locally.\n• \nGenetically modified crops are more resistant to diseases, pests and \nviruses so more crops can be produced.\nFood insecurity is when not all the people have enough food to meet their \nneeds for a healthy and productive life. Food insecurity affects poor people, \nmany of whom live in rural areas. These people try to survive by growing \ntheir own food. This is called subsistence farming. This type of farming \nprovides only enough food for the farmer’s own family.\nSome of the factors (reasons) why people do not have enough food (food \ninsecurity) are:\n• \nThere is a lack of fertile (arable) land on which to grow food.\n• \nClimate change increases natural disasters (droughts and floods) \nthat damage crops.\n• \nWhen you are poor it is more difficult to buy the things you need to \nfarm, such as enough land, equipment, seeds and irrigation systems. \n• \nSubsistence farmers are often uneducated about ways to improve crop \nproduction so land is often overused for crops or overgrazed by cattle.\nSome of the measures (ways) to prevent food insecurity are:\n• \nPrevent soil erosion by practising better farming methods, for \nexample crop rotation or rotational grazing (putting cattle in different \nfields or camps).\n• \nUse efficient ways of storing food, especially when more crops are \nproduced in high-rainfall seasons.\n• \nImprove ways of storing and using water supplies to reduce water \nwastage.\nIn an exam you may be asked \nto define the terms food \nsecurity and food insecurity \nand state the factors that \nlead to food security and \nfood insecurity.
