The following are examples of \nthese calculations for both topographic maps and orthophotos. The \nmethod and formulae are the same for both kinds of maps, but remember \nto use the correct conversion calculation on page 103.\nDistance\nThis is the straight line distance from one point to another or the actual \ndistance, e.g distance along a road, railway, hiking trail, etc.\nWe calculate distance to find out how far one place is from another.\nFormula\nActual distance = map distance × scale\nAD = MD × S\nMethod for calculating distance \nFollow these steps:\nStep 1:  Measure the map distance in centimetres.\nStep 2:  To convert to kilometres, multiply the map distance by 0,5 if \non a topographic map, or by 0,1 if on an orthophoto to get km. \nTo convert to metres, multiply the map distance by 500 if on a \ntopographic map or by 100 if on an orthophoto.\nAlways take note  \nof the unit in which the \nanswer must be given, \nfor example km \nor m."
