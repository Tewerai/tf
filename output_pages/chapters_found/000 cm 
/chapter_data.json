These calculations will be explained \nby means of examples. \nWhen doing calculations, you will be required to give an answer in \nkilometres or metres. Always take note of whether the calculation is to be \ndone from a topographic map or an orthophoto, as this will change your \nscale. The orthophoto scale is larger and provides more detail. Use the \nconversion table below (Table 5.3).\nTOPOGRAPHIC MAP \n1 cm : 50 000 cm \n1 cm = 500 m \n1 cm = 0,5 km\nORTHOPHOTO MAP \n1 cm: 10"
