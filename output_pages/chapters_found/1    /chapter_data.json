    "artment of Basic Education 2014\nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography \nCHAPTER 5 MAPWORK  129\nChapter\n5\nMethod for calculating vertical \nexaggeration\nFollow these steps:\nStep 1:  Change the vertical scale from a word scale to a number \nscale. The vertical scale will be given to you in the question,  \ne.g. 1 cm = 40 m. \n \nYou must have the same units on both sides of the vertical scale \nin order to write it as a number scale. We need to convert 40 m \ninto cm. To do this you multiply the 40 m by 100 (1 m = 100 cm). \nOur scale becomes 1 cm = 4 000 cm or     1    \n4 000.\nStep 2: The horizontal scale is already written as a number scale. On a \ntopographic map the scale is 1:50 000 and on an orthophoto \nthe scale is 1:10 000.\nStep 3: Write both scales as fractions and divide the vertical scale by the \nhorizontal scale:\n \nVE ="
