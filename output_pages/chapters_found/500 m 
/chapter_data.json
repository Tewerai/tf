These calculations will be explained \nby means of examples. \nWhen doing calculations, you will be required to give an answer in \nkilometres or metres. Always take note of whether the calculation is to be \ndone from a topographic map or an orthophoto, as this will change your \nscale. The orthophoto scale is larger and provides more detail. Use the \nconversion table below (Table 5.3).\nTOPOGRAPHIC MAP \n1 cm : 50 000 cm \n1 cm = 500 m \n1 cm = 0,5 km\nORTHOPHOTO MAP \n1 cm: 10 000 cm \n1 cm: 100 m \n1 cm: 0,1 km\nScale\nIf the answer must be in kilometres \n(km)\nIf the answer must be in metres  \n(m)\nTopographic map\n1:50 000 \nMultiply by 0,5 on a topographic map\nMultiply by 500 on a topographic map\nOrthophoto map\n1:10 000 \nMultiply by 0,1 on an orthophoto\nMultiply by 100 on an orthophoto\nTable 5.3: Converting a given scale to kilometres or metres\nTopographic map extract\nOrthophoto map extract\nCalculations in mapwork need a good understanding of difference in \nheight and straight line distance to calculate distance, gradient and area. \nLook at the example and revise these calculations.\nLearn the  \nconversions given in \nTable 5.3 below.\nA 1 : 10 000 \nscale is 5 times  \nlarger than a  \n1 : 50 000 scale.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams"
