If the slope of the line graph is steep, there is more runoff \nthan infiltration. If the slope is gentle, there is more infiltration than runoff. \nThe graph in Figure 2.2.1B has a steep slope, so there is more runoff than \ninfiltration.\nThe highest point on the line graph is the peak flow discharge. This is when \nthe river reaches its highest volume. The difference in time between when it \nrains and when the peak flow discharge occurs is called the time lag. The time \nlag is affected by the amount of runoff and infiltration that occurs. More runoff \ncauses a shorter time lag and more infiltration causes a longer time lag.\nThe following factors influence the time lag:\n• \nAmount of vegetation (increased vegetation reduces runoff and \ncauses a longer time lag)\n• \nSteepness of slope (a steeper slope increases runoff and causes a \nshorter time lag)\n• \nAmount of rainfall (lots of rainfall increases runoff and causes a \nshorter time lag)\n• \nNature of rainfall (heavy rainfall increases runoff and causes a \nshorter time lag)\nFigure 2.2.1C below shows the difference in the time lag between a natural \ncatchment and an urbanised catchment.\nRiver discharge\nTime\nNatural catchment\nUrbanised catchment\nFigure 2.2.1C: Flow hydrographs and the impact of the type of surface of the \narea surrounding the river\nWe can interpret the flow hydrograph in Figure 2.2.1C as follows:\n• \nThe line graph for the urbanised catchment area is much steeper \nthan the line graph for the natural catchment as there is more runoff \nand less infiltration in the urbanised catchment.\n• \nThis is because the urbanised catchment has less vegetation which \nresults in more runoff.\nNatural catchment \n(more vegetation)\nUrbanised catchment \n(less vegetation)\nMore infiltration \nLess infiltration \nLess runoff\nMore runoff\nLonger time lag\nShorter time lag\nLower peak discharge\nHigher peak discharge\nTable 2.2:  The difference between natural catchment and urbanised catchment\nThe amount of runoff on the surface leads to the development of rivers, \nwhich together form a river system within a drainage basin.\nIn the exam, you may be \nasked to determine the \nimpact on time lag if an area \nthat has a lot of vegetation \n(natural catchment) becomes \nurbanised (is covered by a \ncity).\nAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\np\ncomment\ned examples\nNB\ncomment\nStudy Table 2.2  \n(right) and make sure you \nknow the difference between \na natural catchment and \nan urbanised catchment so \nthat you can interpret flow \nhydrographs in the exam. \nRemember, the catchment \narea refers to the area from \nwhich rainfall flows into a \nriver, lake or reservoir.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nexams"
