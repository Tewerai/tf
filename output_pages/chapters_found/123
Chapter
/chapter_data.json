    "of Basic Education 2014\nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography \nCHAPTER 5 MAPWORK  123\nChapter\n5\nStep 7:  The space between 28' and 29' is divided into 10 decimal \nplaces, in other words, 28,1'; 28,2'; 28,3'; 28,4'; 28,5'; 28,6'; \n28,7'; 28,8' and 28,9'.\nAs the spot height is in the right-hand half of the block, we are only \nconcerned with the 28,5' to 28,9' part of the block.\nOnce you have divided the block in half, divide the half you are \ninterested in equally with 4 lines. This can be done freehand (without \na ruler), but judge carefully so that the spaces are equal.\nSteps 6 and 7 are shown below:\n240 11'\n310 28'\n310 29'\n240 10'\n501\n10,5'\n28,5'\nStep 8:  Line up your ruler with the spot height and the line for latitude \n(on the left of the map). Make a mark. Read off the decimal \nplace for latitude and write it down on your position format.\n \n24° 10,8' S or 24° 10,9' S (both answers are acceptable)\nStep 9:  Line up your ruler with the spot height and the line for longitude \n(at the top of the map). Make a mark. Read off the decimal \nplace for longitude and write it down on your format.\n31° 28,8' E\n240 11'\n310 28'\n310 29'\n240 10'\n501\n10,5'\n28,5'\nIn the exam, position is often \nasked in the multiple-choice \nsection of the paper. Be \ncareful, as an answer may \nlook correct – but longitude \nis written first! You should \nknow this is wrong because \nlatitude is always written \nfirst! \nExample \nThe position of spot height \n501 in Figure 5.1 is…\nA. 31° 28,8’ S; 24°10,8’ E\nB. 31° 28,8’ E; 24° 10,8’ S\nC. 24° 10,8’ S; 31° 28,8’ E\nD. 24°11,8’ S ; 31° 29,8’ E\n(The correct answer is C.)\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITI\nand girl-\nright of \nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\nexams\nMake sure your \nruler is straight \nby lining up the \nmarkings on the ruler with \nany of the lines on the map.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and\nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\nexams"
