Because of a lack of infrastructure in some settlements, the residents are \noften forced to inhabit river banks … People living in these areas often utilise the \ncontaminated surface water for crop irrigation, recreation and domestic and personal \nuse such as for washing, drinking water and cooking without prior treatment.'  \n \nThe 230 km Umgeni River had been chosen for the study because it is the primary \nsource of water for more than 3,5 million people in an area which generates almost  \n65 per cent of the provincial gross domestic product.  \n \n[Source: Mercury] \n  \n \n \nFIGURE 2.1:  PRESSURE CELLS \n \n \n \n[Source: www.northwestpassage.blogspot.com]"
