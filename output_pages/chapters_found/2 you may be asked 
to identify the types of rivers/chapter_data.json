South Africa has a shortage of water33.\n \nTo ensure we have a sustainable supply of water33. \n(2)\n[10]\n2.2 Rivers\nWhen there is less infiltration, more runoff takes place. This starts as sheet \nflow but very soon the water flows in a path called channel flow.\nWhen we study rivers we look at them in different ways:\n• \nTypes of rivers\n• \nRiver discharge\n• \nDrainage basins\n• \nStages and profiles of rivers\n2.2.1 Types of rivers\nThe water table refers to the surface of the water-saturated part of the \nground. The height of the water table changes each season. This gives rise \nto different types of rivers. Rivers are classified depending on when (or if) \nthe river valley cuts into the water table.\nThere are three types of rivers:\n• \nPermanent rivers flow all year round and are always in contact with \nthe water table.\n• \nPeriodic rivers only flow during the rainy season. They are in contact \nwith the water table only in the rainy season.\n• \nEpisodic rivers only flow after heavy rainfall when runoff flows into \nthe river. They do not come into contact with the water table.\nPermanent river\nPeriodic river\nEpisodic river\nKEY:\nWater table (rainy season) \nWater table (dry season) \nFigure 2.2.1A: Cross section of the three different types of rivers\nIn paper 2 you may be asked \nto identify the types of rivers.\nAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\np\ncomment\ned examples\nNB\ncomment\nIn the exam, you may be \ngiven a diagram of a cross \nsection of a river and asked \nto identify the type of river. \nLearn to identify the different \nriver types by redrawing and \nlabelling Figure 2.2.1A.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nexams"
