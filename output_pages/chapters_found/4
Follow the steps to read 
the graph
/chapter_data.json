    "6  CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY OF SOUTH AFRICA \nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n4\nFollow the steps to read \nthe graph\n1. The heading – the graph shows GDP (factor 1) in relation to \ndifferent provinces (factor 2).\n2. The sectors (pieces or slices) of the pie graph show factor 1 – the \ncontribution of each province to the GDP. \n3. Units of measurement – the sectors of the pie graph show factor 1 \n(GDP) in percentage. \n4. The relationship between the different factors – because a pie \nchart compares parts of a whole, you need to note the different \nsizes of the sectors. This tells you how much each province \ncontributes to the total GDP.\n5. Look for anything that is unusual – for example, which is the \nlargest piece of the pie (Gauteng) and which is the smallest piece \nof the pie (Northern Cape).\n6. Now read the questions in activity 4.6.\n Activity 4.6\nThe following questions refer to Figure 4.5.1B on page 95.\n1. Rank the top three provinces in terms of their contribution  \nto the GDP from largest to smallest contribution. \n(1 × 2 = 2)\n2. Give two reasons why the province ranked first in your  \nanswer in question 1 holds that position. \n(2 × 2 = 4)\n3. The following questions refer to the province which  \ncontributes the least to the national GDP.\na) Name the province which contributes the least to the  \nnational GDP. \n(1 × 2 = 2)\nb) Name the ocean current that flows alongside this  \nprovince. \n(1 × 2 = 2)\nc) What impact does this ocean current have on the  \nrainfall in this province? \n(1 × 2 = 2)\nd) Explain how your answer in question c) affects the  \nprovince’s contribution to the GDP. \n(2 × 2 = 4)\n[16]"
