They had a tap for water; they had \nfirewood. Then the farm was sold to a new owner who wanted the Skhosanas off the \nland. For two years, they fought eviction. After all, this was the 'new' South Africa, and, \nfor the first time, they had rights. But the farm owner shut down their water tap and \nordered them to stop gathering wood on his land. Finally, the owner came early one \nmorning when the children were still asleep, broke down the door, and threw the \nfamily's furniture and belongings onto the road. The children were afraid they would \nhave nowhere to sleep. Mr Skhosana was ill and could not work anymore.  \nMrs Skhosana says she will never forget the experience of 'being thrown out like \nrubbish'.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n  \n \n \nFIGURE 4.5:  INFORMAL TRADE \n \n \n \nInformal means something relaxed, casual, flexible and without rules and regulations. If \nwe talk about an informal economy, then we refer to an economy which does not have \nrules and regulations. A business in the informal economy, for example, doesn't pay \ntax. It does not follow the laws which control bigger, formal businesses.  \n       \n  \n \nMa'Mlambo's \nFRESH \nfruit and vegetables \nSTORAGE \nGeography/P1 \n12 \nDBE/2014 \n \nNSC – Grade 12 Exemplar – Annexure \nCopyright reserved \n \n \nFIGURE 4.6:  THE GAUTENG (PWV) INDUSTRIAL REGION \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \nCentral business district and industrial area \nProclaimed mining area \nResidential area \nMain road \nRailway \nRosslyn \nCenturion \nKempton Park \nRandburg \nRandfontein \nCarletonville \nGermiston \nNigel \nHeidelberg \nMeyerton \nVereeniging \nVanderbijlpark \nG \nD \nB \nC \nINSERT A \nINSERT B \nWater \nLabour \n Fuel/Power \nMarket \n0 5 10 15 20 \nkilometres"
