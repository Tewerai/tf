    "of Basic Education 2014\n58  CHAPTER 3 RURAL SETTLEMENT AND URBAN SETTLEMENT \nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n3\nIn Paper 1 or Paper 2 you may be asked to identify the street \npattern and state the advantages and disadvantages of the street \npattern. You may also be asked to give the age of a settlement based on the street \npattern in the settlement.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\nRadial street pattern\n• The roads spread out from a central point, similar to a spider’s web.\n• Found in very old cities like Paris in Europe or Kimberley in South \nAfrica. It is also found in more recently planned cities like Sasolburg \nin South Africa.\nAdvantages of the radial street pattern \n• Easier flow of traffic\n• All roads lead to central point in town, for example a place of \nworship, monument, town square, etc.\nDisadvantages of the radial street pattern\n• Traffic jams are common as all roads lead to the centre\n• Traffic is slow as there are no shortcuts\n• Space is wasted\nFigure 3.3.3E: Radial street pattern\nPlanned irregular street pattern\n• The roads have few intersections and curve a lot.\n• Found in modern cities and newer suburbs\nAdvantages of the planned irregular street pattern\n• Improves the flow of traffic\n• Roads are quieter because there are fewer intersections and less \nthrough-traffic\n• Interesting suburb layout because of unexpected turns in the road\n• Accommodates the nature of the topography\nDisadvantages of the planned irregular street pattern\n• It is easy to get lost.\n• It is not easy to subdivide or expand.\nFigure 3.3.3F:  Planned irregular  \nstreet pattern\nUnplanned irregular street pattern\n• There is no clear design or plan to these roads.\n• Typical of informal settlements\nAdvantages of the unplanned street pattern\n• One of a kind (unique) pattern\nDisadvantages of the unplanned street pattern\n• Traffic congestion\n• Unplanned/no order\n• Get lost easily\nFigure 3.3.3G:  Unplanned irregular  \nstreet pattern \nUrban land use zones\nThe structure of an urban area can be studied by looking \nat the different land use zones in a city. A land use zone \nis an area which has features that define its function. For \nexample, a residential area is made up of houses or flats, \nrecreational areas, schools and shops. These features tell us \nthat people live in the area. Another example is an industrial \narea, which is made up of many large buildings (factories), \nmajor transport routes and few open or green areas.\nUrban street \npatterns will be tested \nin activity 3.5 in the \nmapwork interpretation of \nsettlement based on \nthe Nelspruit map."
