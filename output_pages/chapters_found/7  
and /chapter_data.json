Why are there more houses and plantations on a slope in a valley?\nDetermine which slope faces north. North-facing slopes are the warmest \nand people choose to live there. Plants also grow better there.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\n4. Where will the thermal belt occur?\nDetermine where the valley is and where halfway up the valley would be. \nThis is where you will find the thermal belt (temperature inversion).\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\n5.

Does the area experience high rainfall?\nDetermine the amount of cultivated land, the number of perennial rivers \n(flow all year round) and the total number of rivers in an area (drainage \ndensity). High-rainfall areas have lots of cultivated land, many perennial \nrivers indicate high drainage density.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\n7. \nDoes the area experience low rainfall?\nDetermine the amount of cultivated land, the number of perennial rivers \n(flow all year round) and non-perennial rivers (only flow in the rainy season), \nand the total number of rivers in an area (drainage density). Low-rainfall \nareas have very little cultivated land; few, if any, perennial rivers and many non-\nperennial rivers; and few rivers, indicating low drainage density.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\n8. Does the area experience seasonal rainfall?\nDetermine the number of non-perennial streams, dams, furrows and \nwhether the cultivated land is next to a river. Seasonal rainfall areas have \nmostly non-perennial rivers, many dams, furrows and the cultivated land is \nnext to the perennial rivers.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\nexams\nQuestions 6, 7  \nand 8 also test some \ngeomorphology \nknowledge."
