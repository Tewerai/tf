    "The nature of the landscape over which the rivers flow will determine how \nthe water moves in the river systems. Figure 2.2.1D (right) shows the two \ntypes of flow, namely laminar and turbulent flow.\nA smooth channel causes  a laminar flow of water and is more efficient. \nLess of the available energy is used to overcome friction (found on the lower \ncourse of a river).\nA rough channel causes a turbulent flow of water. An uneven rocky bed \ncauses an uneven flow of water. This increases the surface area for friction. \nThis type of flow is very inefficient (found on the upper course of a river).\n2.2.2 Drainage basins\nA drainage basin is an area \ndrained by a river system. \nYou need to know the \ndifferent parts of a drainage \nbasin to understand the \nother aspects of rivers, \nsuch as a river’s source, \nriver mouth, watershed and \ntributaries. Figure 2.2.2A \n(right) shows the different \nparts of a drainage basin.\nA river does not flow by \nitself but is part of a river \nsystem (a main river and all \nits tributaries). \nWe will now look at two \naspects of river systems: drainage density and drainage patterns.\nDrainage density\nDrainage density describes how many streams there are in a drainage \nbasin. Drainage density is affected by the same factors that affect runoff \nand infiltration:\n• \nMore infiltration will cause fewer rivers to occur, causing a low \ndrainage density.\n• \nMore runoff will cause more rivers to occur, causing a high drainage \ndensity.\nFigure 2.2.2B (i) (right) shows a low drainage density and Figure 2.2.2B (ii) \n(right) shows a high drainage density.\nInterpretation of Figure 2.2.2B (i):\nDrainage basin (i) has fewer tributaries so it has a low drainage density. \nSome reasons for low drainage density are:\n• \nSoft rainfall causing more infiltration\n• \nGentle slopes causing more infiltration\n• \nLots of vegetation causing more infiltration\n• \nVery little rain so the ground can still hold more water causing more \ninfiltration\nFigure 2.2.2A: \nThe different parts of a drainage basin\nWatershed\nSource\nTributaries\nRiver mouth\nFigure 2.2.2B: Low drainage \ndensity (i) and high drainage \ndensity (ii)\n(i)\n(ii)\nFigure 2.2.1D Turbulent and \nLaminar flow\nLearn Figure 2.2.2A in order \nto label a similar diagram in \nan exam question.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\nYou may be asked in an exam \nto give reasons for an area \nhaving a high or low drainage \ndensity.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITI\nand girl-\nright of p\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\nexams\nLaminar\nTurbulant"
