This is similar to reading a comprehension text before answering the \nquestions. You will need to UNDERSTAND the table or graph in order to answer the \nquestions.\nECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nstep\ncomment\norked examples\nNB\ny\ncomment\n4.5.1 Understanding graphs\nIn this section we look at two types of graphs: bar graphs and pie charts. \nFollow these steps when you read a graph:\nSteps to reading a bar graph\nStep 1: The heading of a graph will tell you what the graph shows and \nwhat is being compared. It will tell you how the two or more factors \nshown on the graph are connected. In other words, it will tell you what \nthe relationship is between the factors shown.\nStep 2: Look at the labels on the different axes to see what factors \nare being compared on the graph. These should be the same factors \nmentioned in the heading.\nStep 3: Look at the units of measurement on the different axes, for \nexample percentage and time, or amount of money compared across \neconomic sectors.\nStep 4: Look at what is being compared and how the factors affect one \nanother. In other words, try and understand the relationship between the \ndifferent factors. For example, as the one factor increases so the other \nfactor may decrease, or as one factor increases so the other factor may \nstay the same.\nThe next section  \nwill help you to understand \ngraphs and tables in \neconomic geography. Learn \nthis information to prepare  \nfor this section of  \nthe exam.\n Here are some \nhelpful guidelines \nthat show you to \nhow to read and \nunderstand graphs.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and\nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\nexams"
