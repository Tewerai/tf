    "TER 2 GEOMORPHOLOGY \nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n2\nInterpretation of Figure 2.2.2B (ii):\nDrainage basin (ii) has more tributaries so it has a high drainage density. \nSome reasons for high drainage density are:\n• \nHeavy rainfall causing more runoff\n• \nSteep slopes causing more runoff\n• \nVery little vegetation causing more runoff\n• \nLots of rain so the ground cannot hold any more water causing more \nrunoff\n Activity 2.2\nRefer to drainage basins A and B in Figure 2.2.2C and the flow hydrograph \nshowing line graphs D and E after a period of rainfall, to answer the \nfollowing questions.\n1. The rivers in drainage basin A flow all year  \nround. What type of river would this be  \nclassified as? \n(1 × 2 = 2)\n2. Graph D in the flow hydrograph shows the  \nrunoff of drainage basin A after a period of rain.\na) Define the term ‘lag time’. \n(1 × 2 = 2)\nb) How would the lag time change if massive \ndeforestation were to occur in drainage  \nbasin A where D was recorded? \n(1 × 2 = 2)\nc) Justify your answer in question b). (2 × 2 = 4)\nd) Name another factor which could occur  \nand have the same impact on the lag  \ntime as mentioned in question b). (1 × 2 = 2)\n3. a) \nState the drainage density of drainage  \n \nbasin B. \n(1 × 2 = 2)\nb) Describe THREE possible causes for the drainage density  \nfound in drainage basin B. \n(3 × 2 = 6)\n[20]\nAnswers to activity 2.2\n1. Permanent river33 \n(2)\n2. a)  The difference in time between when it rains and when the \npeak flow discharge occurs.33 \n(2)\nb) Lag time will be shorter33 \n(2)\nc) There is less vegetation33, so there is more runoff33. \n(4)\nd) Steep slope33/Heavy rainfall33/Lots of rain33 \n(any 1)(2)\n3. a) High drainage density33 \n(2)\nb) Heavy rainfall causing more runoff33\n \nSteep slopes causing more runoff33\n \nVery little vegetation causing more runoff33\n \nLots of rain so the ground cannot hold any more water \ncausing more runoff33 \n(any 3)(6)\n[20]\nComplete  \nactivity 2.2 to  \npractise the concepts  \nyou have learnt so far  \nin this chapter.\nA\nB\nQ\nD\nE\nFigure 2.2.2C: Drainage basins and flow \nhydrograph"
