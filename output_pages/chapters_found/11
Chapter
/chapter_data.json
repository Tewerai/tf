Let us look at each factor in more detail.\n1.3.1 The impact of the ocean \nand the ocean currents on South \nAfrica’s climate\nMuch of South Africa is surrounded by oceans. The oceans affect the \ntemperature at the coast and inland as follows:\n• \nWater heats up slowly and cools down slowly. \n• \nThis moderates temperatures along the coastline (i.e. the minimum \nand maximum temperatures are not very far apart) – also known as \nmaritime.\n• \nThis causes temperatures inland to be extreme (i.e. the minimum \nand maximum temperatures are very far apart) – also known as \ncontinental.\nFor example, in winter the temperature in Johannesburg is a maximum of \n25°C and a minimum of 1°C (extreme), whereas in Durban the maximum \nis 24°C and the minimum is 15°C (moderate).\nThe  \nwarm Agulhas  \ncurrent flows along the \nsouth coast. However, you \ndo not need to know how \nit affects the country’s \nclimate."
