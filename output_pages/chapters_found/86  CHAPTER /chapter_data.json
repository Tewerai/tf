    "of Basic Education 2014\n86  CHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY OF SOUTH AFRICA \nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n4\nIn the next sections we focus on factors that affect the location of industries \nand the factors that favour or hinder the development of secondary \neconomic activity. We look at the development of the four main industrial \nregions in South Africa:\n• \nPretoria–Witwatersrand–Vereeniging complex (PWV) (Gauteng)\n• \nDurban–Pinetown (Ethekwini)\n• \nPort Elizabeth–Uitenhage (Nelson Mandela Bay)\n• \nSouthwestern Cape\n4.2.1 Industrial development in \nSouth Africa\nThe availability of raw materials in South Africa has led to the development \nof large industries (factories) that process the raw materials or use semi-\nfinished products to manufacture final products.\nFactors affecting the location of an industry\nWhen deciding where to site an industry, the following two factors are the \nmost important: \n• \nRaw materials: How close are the natural resources or raw materials \nthe industry needs to make its product?\n• \nMarkets: How close is the industry to the market where it sells its \nproduct? In other words, how close are the consumers (the people \nthat buy the product)?\nAn industry will locate itself close to either the raw materials or the market. \nIf the raw material is large and difficult to transport, the industry will locate \nclose to the raw material. This industry would be called raw-material \norientated.\nIf the raw material is smaller and easier to transport, the industry will locate \nclose to the market. The industry would be called market orientated.\nThe following factors can also affect the location of an industry:\n• \nTransport: Access to major transport routes between the industry, \nthe raw material source and the market.\n• \nEnergy: A reliable supply of electricity is needed to be able to process \nraw materials or manufacture goods.\n• \nLabour: A skilled and unskilled work force must live in the area where \nthe industry is located.\n• \nLink industries: These are industries that you sell your product to. \nHow close the industry is to its link industries will affect its transport \ncosts.\n• \nGovernment policies: Government may offer subsidies or tax \nincentives to industries that locate in certain areas, which may help \nto decrease costs."
