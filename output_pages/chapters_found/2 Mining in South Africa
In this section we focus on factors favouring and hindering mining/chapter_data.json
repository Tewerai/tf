There \nare different types of mining: open cast and shaft mining. \nFactors favouring (promoting) mining \nThese factors make mining more productive and profitable:\n• \nSouth Africa has many different minerals which can be mined and \nused in factories or exported so the country earns foreign exchange.\n• \nSouth African mines benefit from having lots of local unskilled \nlabour. This results in lower labour costs and therefore higher profits.\n• \nForeign skilled miners come to work in South African mines and the \nmines benefit from their knowledge and skills.\n• \nMany countries invested money in our mines, which assisted with \nfurther development of the mines and a lowering of costs.\n• \nA well-developed infrastructure (roads and railway lines, water and \nelectricity) assists mines to do business.\nFactors hindering (restrict/limit) mining\nThese factors make mining less productive and less profitable:\n• \nThe high temperatures in some underground mines create difficult \nworking conditions and this decreases productivity.\n• \nLarge distances between the mines and the harbours or towns \nincrease the cost of transporting the minerals to the markets.\n• \nThere are high costs involved in training and housing mine workers. \n• \nMine worker strikes decrease productivity and profits.\n• \nWater shortages and underground flooding of mines are a serious \nproblem. It is expensive to fix the problem and this decreases profits.\n• \nEnsuring safety on the mines is costly, especially when tunnel roofs \ncollapse.\nThe importance of mining to \nthe South African economy \n(role of mining in SA)\nMining benefits the economy and people in these ways:\n• \nThe mining sector provides many jobs, which decreases \nunemployment.\n• \nMines supply raw materials to secondary activities such as factories \nand industries. This in turn stimulates industrial development.\n• \nWhen mines start up, new towns and transport networks develop \naround the mines.\n• \nMining stimulates other sectors of the economy, such as farming, \nbuilding and trade, to meet the needs of the growing number of \npeople who live and work in mining towns.\n• \nHarbours, like those at Saldanha Bay (Western Cape) and Richards \nBay (KwaZulu-Natal), expand (grow bigger) to cope with increased \nmineral exports to other countries. This creates more jobs and also \nhelps other sectors of the economy to grow.\n• \nThe export of mining products increases the profits of the mines \nbecause they earn foreign exchange.\nUse the following word mnemonic to \nhelp you remember the factors that \nfavour mining in South Africa:\nM = Minerals \nÒ Miners\nL = Labour \nÒ Love\nF = Foreign \nÒ Finding\nI = Investment \nÒ Important\nI = Infrastructure Ò Irons\nUse the following word mnemonic to \nhelp you remember the factors that \nhinder mining in South Africa:\nS = Safety \nÒ Sometimes\nW = Water \nÒ Workers\nC = Costs \nÒ Can\nD = Distances \nÒ Dig\nT = Temperatures Ò Too\nS = Strikes \nÒ Slowly"
