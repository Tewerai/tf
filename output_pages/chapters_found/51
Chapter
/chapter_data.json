It is difficult to build on clay because water collects on top \nof this type of soil.\n• \nRock structure: Sites which are far from sinkholes, fault lines and \nvolcanoes are better to build on.\n• \nRelief: Sites with gentle gradients are preferred, as building costs \nare cheaper.\n• \nTransport and trade: Development often occurs at a river crossing.\n• \nHuman factors: Sites with historical, cultural or social value attract \npeople to live in the area.\nIn an exam you may be \nasked to identify factors \nthat affected the choice of \na particular settlement in \na diagram. In this type of \nquestion, if a key is given \nlook at it carefully to help you \nanswer the question.
