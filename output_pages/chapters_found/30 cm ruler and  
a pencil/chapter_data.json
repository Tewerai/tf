It consists of the following sections:\n• \nMapwork calculations\n• \nReading, interpretation and analysis of theory\n• \nGeographical Information Systems (GIS)\nMaps tell you a story about a place. Look at all the information given on \nthe map to interpret it:\n• \nWhat is the name on the top of the map?\n• \nLook at the latitude and longitude. Get an idea where the map is. For \nexample, 20°S would indicate it is in Limpopo.\n• \nLook at all the information provided (magnetic declination \ninformation, scale of the map, contour interval, map projection used) \nin the ‘margins’ of the map.\n• \nLook at the bottom of the map, for the diagram showing the map \nsheet reference. It may show additional information such as oceans \nor borders.\n• \nNotice where roads or railways go off the map. The town they lead to \nmay give you clues. \n• \nMake use of the key/reference list to identify features. Remember, \nthe first word in the reference list refers to the first picture and not \nboth pictures.\nLook for the following aspects on the map:\n• \nIs this a high or low rainfall area? Is the rainfall seasonal?\n• \nWhat kinds of rivers are visible and how many are there?\n• \nIdentify the urban and rural areas.\n• \nIdentify the different land uses in the mapped area, for example, \nagricultural/industrial/built-up areas.\n• \nWhat factors may have affected the location of various land uses? \nFor example, industry alongside a perennial river.\n• \nIdentify the type of farming – is it commercial or subsistence?\n• \nLook at the relief – is it flat or hilly, are the slopes steep or gentle? \nLook at the contour lines to determine this.\nLook at the information given in the orthophoto:\n• \nIs the orthophoto labelled? If not, check the numbers or letters in the \nquestion, for example: ‘Identify land use labelled G on orthophoto’ – \nG will only be on one of the photos.\n• \nIs a rectangle drawn around the area covered by the orthophoto? If \nnot, orientate the photo to the map.\n• \nRead the instructions carefully as you may need to use both the map \nand the photograph to answer a question.\n• \nMake use of all the information on the orthophoto, for example, road \nnames, heights, etc.\nRemember your \ncalculator, protractor, \n30 cm ruler and  \na pencil.\nA topographic \nmap is a way to \nshow mountains, \nvalleys and aspects of a \nlandscape by means of \ncontour lines and intervals.\nAn orthophoto map is a \ncorrected aerial photograph. \nHuman-made and other \nfeatures that are not clear are \nlabelled on the orthophoto. \nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\nexams"
