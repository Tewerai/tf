    "of Basic Education 2014\n24  CHAPTER 2 GEOMORPHOLOGY \nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n2\n2.1 Groundwater\nGroundwater is water stored beneath the Earthâ€™s surface. When \nprecipitation (rain) falls to the surface of the Earth, it either flows over the \nsurface (runoff) or it is absorbed (infiltrates) into the groundwater supply. \nThis section studies how the infiltration, runoff and groundwater systems \nwork and lead to the formation of rivers. Refer to Figure 2.1A below of the \nwater cycle (this was studied in Grade 10).\nEvaporation\nCondensation\nTransport\nPrecipitation\nInfiltration\nSurface \nrunoff\nOcean\nRiver discharge\nWater table\nGroundwater\nBedrock\nStream \nflow\nFigure 2.1A: The water cycle\nGroundwater supplies are replenished (filled up) when water infiltrates \ninto the ground. For water to infiltrate into the soil, three important aspects \nshould be present:\n1. Enough porous soil or rock to allow the water to infiltrate through it.\n2. Time for the surface water to be absorbed into the ground. This is \naffected by the steepness of the slope and the nature of the rain. \n3. Vegetation (plants) to slow down the speed of runoff, making it \neasier for infiltration to happen."
