From the diagram we can see how the amount of groundwater \naffects the height of the water table. This is the level below which the \nground is saturated (when it can hold no more water).\nPrecipitation\nInfiltration\nRunoff loss \nby overland \nflow\nSoil layer\nWater table\nGroundwater\nBase flow\nStream \nrunoff\nMoisture loss \nby transpiration \nand \nevaporation\nFigure 2.1B: Factors that affect groundwater and movement of water on the \nsurface\n Activity 2.1\n1. List three important things that should be present for  \nwater to infiltrate into the soil. \n(3 × 2 = 6)\n2. Describe how groundwater supplies are replenished  \n(filled up). \n(1 × 2 = 2)\n3.
