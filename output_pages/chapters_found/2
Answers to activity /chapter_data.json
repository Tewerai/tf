This changes what the river looks like \nfrom its source to its mouth:\n• \nIn its upper course, a river erodes vertically (downwards) creating \nsteep valleys.\n• \nIn the middle course, lateral erosion and a little bit of deposition \noccur. The lateral erosion occurs unequally (unevenly) on the sides \nof the river. This causes the river to start meandering (flowing or \nbending from side to side).\n• \nBy the time the river reaches its lower course, the eroded material \n(sediment) carried by the river begins to be deposited onto the \nfloodplains. A floodplain is a wide, flat area alongside a river.\n• \nFloodplains are formed by the river eroding laterally (sideways). In \nthe lower course the meanders may be cut off when the river flows \nstraight, forming an ox-bow (U-shaped) lake.\nFigure 2.2.3A (see page 33) shows the stages of a river in plan  \nview.\nFigure 2.2.3B (see page 33) shows the stages of a river in oblique  \nview.\nTable 2.3 (see page 33) summarises the features of a river at  \neach stage.\nYou may be asked in an exam to identify the stage of a river \nfrom a plan view, an oblique view or a cross section diagram. You \nmay also be asked to draw a river in a plan view or a cross section diagram of a river \nat a particular stage. To do this, learn the characteristic features of each stage. This is \nalso useful for identifying the stage of a river on a topographic map.\nEXAM \nTIP\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nhint\ntip\nactivity\nexam\nactivity"
