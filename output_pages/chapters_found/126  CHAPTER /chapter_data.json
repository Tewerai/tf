Give the map sheet reference for the map to the south-east of \n3318CD.\n2. Give the map sheet reference for the map to the south-west of \n3318CD.\nAnswers:\n1. 3418BA\n2. 3418AA\nVertical exaggeration\nIn mapwork, we draw a cross section (view from the side) of an area or \nlandform to better understand what the area or landform looks like.\nA cross section is when we ‘cut’ through a landform, to see what it looks \nlike from the side. Figure 5.3.2 below shows a cross section through a tap.\nFigure 5.3.2: A cross section through a tap\nTo draw a cross section of a landform, we need to look at the contour lines. \nThese are the brown lines we see all over a topographic map. Contour lines \nshow the height of the area. Along one contour line, the height is the same.\nStudy \nFigure 5.3.2  \nto understand what  \nis meant by the term \ncross section. \nWhen answering this type of question, take note of the following:\n• If you are asked for the grid reference north and you go north (up) out of the big \nblock, the latitude must decrease by 1°.\n• If you are asked for the grid reference south and you go south (down) out of the big \nblock, the latitude must increase by 1°.\n• If you are asked for the grid reference east and you go east (right) out of the big \nblock, the longitude must increase by 1°.\n• If you are asked for the grid reference west and you go west (left) out of the big \nblock, the longitude must decrease by 1°.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams"
