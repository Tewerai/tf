    "136  CHAPTER 5 MAPWORK \nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n5\n5.5 Geographical information \nsystems – GIS\nGIS is an organised collection of computers, computer programmes, \ngeographic data and people. This definition gives you the components that \nmake up GIS: People who know how to use computers (hardware) and \nprogrammes (software) to provide information (from geographic data) are \nable to solve a problem or answer a specific question.\nKey concepts\nConcept\nDefinition\nComponents \nof GIS\nHardware (computers), software (computer programmes), data \n(information), people, procedures (how to solve a problem or \nanswer a question), network (where to get the information from).\nSpatial data\nSpatial data refers to the position of an object, in other words, \nits co-ordinates.\nFor example, the spatial data for a tree could be: 29°30,3' S; \n19°10,8' E\nAttribute \ndata\nAttribute data is information that describes or gives the \ncharacteristics of an object.\nFor example, the attribute data for a tree could be: It is an \nacacia tree, which is 5 m tall.\nVector data\nSpatial data stored in the form of co-ordinates, shown as point, \nline or polygon features.\na)  Point \nfeatures\nPoint features on a map include spot height, buildings and trig. \nstations.\nb)  Line \nfeatures\nLine features on a map include rivers, roads and walls.\nc)  Polygon \nfeatures\nPolygon features on a map include cultivated land, built-up \nareas and dams.\nIn a mapwork exam, you may be asked to identify a point, line or \npolygon feature on a map. Look at the conventional signs shown in \nthe block (referred to in the question).\n• Point features are indicated by a circle (e.g. spot height), triangle (e.g. trig. station), \nsquare (e.g. building, post office), rectangle (e.g. factory) or a single object (wind \npump, dipping tank).\n• Line features are indicated by a straight line (e.g. farm boundary, wall) or a curved \nline (e.g. rivers, roads and railways).\n• A polygon feature is any sign that takes up more space than a single feature, for \nexample, a dam, cultivated land, built-up area or golf course.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nexams\nIf you know  \nand understand this  \ndefinition of geographic \ninformation systems  (GIS), then \nyou will be able to answer the \nrelevant questions in the mapwork \nsection of the final exam. \nUse mobile notes to \n help you learn these  \nkey concepts."
