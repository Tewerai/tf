Therefore, \nplaces on the plateau (high altitude) will \nexperience lower temperatures than places \nat a lower altitude.\nPlaces in the Lowveld (Mpumalanga) have higher temperatures than \nplaces on the Highveld (Gauteng and Free State).\n1.3.3 The impact of the subtropical \nhigh pressure belt on South Africa’s \nclimate\nSouth Africa is affected by three high pressure cells:\n• \nSouth Atlantic high pressure (SAHP)\n• \nSouth Indian high pressure (SIHP)\n• \nKalahari high pressure (KHP)\nWest \ncoast\nEast \ncoast\nEscarpment\nPlateau\nFigure 1.3.2A: Cross-section of South Africa from west to east \nshowing the relief of the country"
