These channels will cut into the rock surface where it is easiest \nto erode the rock. These channels form patterns known as drainage \npatterns. Figure 2.2.2D, E, F below show three types of drainage patterns.\nFigure 2.2.2D: Dendritic pattern\nName: Dendritic \nDescription: Looks like the branches of a tree with tributaries joining the \nmain river at acute angles\nExplanation: Occurs where the underlying rock is of homogenous (equal) \nresistance, namely either horizontal (flat) sedimentary rock, massive \nigneous or metamorphic rock\nFigure 2.2.2E: Trellis pattern\nName: Trellis \nDescription: Parallel streams with short tributaries joining at right angles \n(90°)\nExplanation: Occurs where the surface rock is of alternate resistance \n(strong and weak rock), or where sedimentary rock is folded\nFigure 2.2.2F: Radial pattern\nName: Radial\nDescription: Streams flow outwards from one raised central point (dome or \nvolcano)\nExplanation: Rivers flow downhill and away from the highest central point.\n Activity 2.3\nIdentify and briefly describe the drainage patterns in Figure 2.2.3G below.\n \n(3 × 4 = 12)\n[12]\nA\nB\nC\nFigure 2.2.3G: Drainage patterns\nYou may be asked in an exam to identify the drainage pattern, \ndescribe the pattern (what it looks like) or explain what caused the \npattern to occur. When you are asked to explain the cause of the drainage pattern, you \nmay be required to name the underlying rock structure in the area.\nECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nstep\ncomment\norked examples\nNB\ncomment\nFigures \n2.2.2 D, E and F \nsummarise the main \nthings you need to  \nlearn about drainage \npatterns."
