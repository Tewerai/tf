For example: \n5 × 6 = 30’. So, the MD is now 23°30’ W. The decimal comma has been removed and \nyou have a MD in degrees and minutes.\nNow look at the following worked example:\nMean magnetic declination (MD) 18º,3 west of true north (1985.01)\nMean annual change (AC) 1’ westwards (1980–1990)\nMD\nTN\nMN\nCalculating magnetic declination for 2012\nMD = 18°,3 W of TN = 18° 18’ W of TN\nAC = 1’ W\n2012 – 1985 = 27 years \n27 × 1’ W = 27’ W\nMD = 18° 18’ W + 27’ W = 18° 45’ W of TN\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\n  Worked example 4: If the magnetic \ndeclination answer has the minutes \ngreater than 59’\nOnce you have done your calculation, if the magnetic declination for the current year has \nminutes greater than 59’ you need to convert the minutes to degrees.\nFor example: MD = 23° 76’\n76’ – 60’ leaves 16’. The 60 minutes you subtracted equal 1 degree, which you add to \nthe 23° to get 24° 16’.\nNow look at the following worked example:\nMean magnetic declination (MD) 31º 33’ west of true north (1990.08)\nMean annual change (AC) 2’ westwards (1987–1993)\nRemember that  \n1° = 60’ (1 degree =  \n60 minutes)"
