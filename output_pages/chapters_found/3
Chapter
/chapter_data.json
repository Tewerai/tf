    "nt of Basic Education 2014\nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography \nCHAPTER 1 CLIMATE AND WEATHER  3\nChapter\n1\n1.1 Introduction\nOur focus will be on the South African climate, mid-latitude cyclones, \ntropical cyclones, sub-tropical anticyclones and local climate (valley and \ncity climate). But first we need to understand synoptic weather charts \n(maps), and satellite images.\n1.1.1 Synoptic weather map \ninterpretation\nTo better understand weather patterns and weather phenomena you need \nto be able to interpret the synoptic weather map. A synoptic weather map \nshows weather conditions and phenomena (temperature, precipitation, \nwind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure and cloud coverage) over \na wide area at a given time based on worldwide observations recorded at \nthe same time (from weather stations, airplanes, weather balloons and \nsatellites).\nOn a synoptic weather map there are lines called isobars:\n• \nThese lines join points of equal pressure (all along one isobar the \npressure is the same). \n• \nThe pressure is measured in hectopascals (hpa)/millibars (mb).\n• \nThe isobars form patterns (shapes formed by many isobars).  \nFigures 1.1.1A and B show a low pressure and a high pressure cell.\nFigure 1.1.1A: Low pressure cell as  \nseen on a synoptic weather chart\nFigure 1.1.1B: High pressure cell as  \nseen on a synoptic weather chart\nFigure 1.1.1C on page 4 shows a simple weather station. It describes the \nweather of a particular place that is found on a synoptic weather map.\nIn the exam, you may be asked to describe the weather of a particular \nplace on the synoptic weather map by referring to the weather station. You \nwill need to comment on the following weather elements:\n• \nCloud cover \n• \nWind direction\n• \nWind speed\n• \nAir temperature\n• \nDew point temperature\n• \nPrecipitation (any form of water falling from the sky, e.g. rain, hail, \nsnow and ice)\nNote that \nthe  pressure reading \ndecreases towards the centre \nof a Low and increases \ntowards the centre of a \nHigh.\n \nSynoptic weather maps are \nvery often tested in the exam.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams"
