The marked-off area is the buffer zone. \nBuffer zones often protect people from living in a dangerous area.\nFor example, along a river people should live above the 50-year flood line. The 50-year flood \nline is the height below which the river floods. The area below the 50-year flood line is the \nbuffer zone for this area. If you live in the buffer zone your home is likely to be affected when \nthe river floods. If you take notice of the buffer zone and live above the 50-year flood line, \nyour home is likely to be safe when the river floods.\nFigure 5.5.1 below shows how point, line and polygon features have buffer zones placed \naround them.\nBuffering a \nmultipoint\nBuffering a \npoint\nBuffering a polygon \nwith one interior ring\nBuffering a \nlinestring\nFigure 5.5.1: Buffer zones\nRaster data\nSpatial data stored in the form of pixels. Pixels are similar to the blocks found on a \ntopographic map (e.g. block A3). The size of the pixel (block) will determine in how much \ndetail an area will be shown. Smaller pixels show more detail. Larger pixels show less detail.\nRemote sensing\nTaking a picture of something from far away, for example from a satellite.\nSpatial resolution\nHow clear and easy the detail is to see.\nData or thematic \nlayering\nWhen different kinds of information are placed  \none on top of the other to see the overall picture.\nFor example, on the Nelspruit map, the layers of  \ndata needed to draw block D1 are:\n• Vegetation\n• Contour lines\n• Roads\n• Power lines\n• Built-up areas\n• Water\nFigure 5.5.2 illustrates the idea of data layering.\nData sharing \nData sharing is the practice of making data used for scholarly research available to other \ninvestigators.\nData \nstandardisation\nIt is the process of achieving agreement on common data definitions, representation and \nstructures to which all data layers must conform.\nData security\nThis means protecting a database from destructive forces and the unwanted actions of \nunauthorised users. This may be done by encryption, firewall or password.\nData querying\nThis is a process used to retrieve or get data from the data base.\nStatistical \nanalysis\nThe collection of methods used to process large amounts of data and report overall trends.\nCustomers\nBuildings\nStreets\nReality\nFigure 5.5.2: Data layering"
