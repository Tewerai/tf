    "ography \nCHAPTER 4 ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY OF SOUTH AFRICA  83\nChapter\n4\n Activity 4.2\nThe cartoon in Figure 4.1.1 below shows how environmental problems can \naffect food security.\nWake up, people! Many environmental problems threaten our food security... \nLike overfishing...\nAnd climate change...\nWe’ll all be \nbetter off if we \nlimit our fishing \nso that there will \nbe enough fish \nfor next year.\nUnfortunately, they are not \ngoing to like rising sea levels.\nEach individual fisherman wants to \nmaximise his profit, but too much fishing \ncan destroy the fishery for everyone.\nOut of the way, there’s \nprofit to be made!\nI like cheap electricity!\nI like cheap fertilisers!\nI like \ncheap \npetrol!\nFigure 4.1.1: Factors contributing to food insecurity\n1. How has the use of fossil fuels and fertilisers caused  \nclimate change? \n(3 × 2 = 6)\n2. How does climate change link to rising sea levels? \n(2 × 2 = 4)\n3. How would rising sea levels affect food security? \n(1 × 2 = 2)\n4. Explain your answer in question 3.  \n(1 × 2 = 2)\n5. Name another factor in the cartoon that would affect  \nfood security. \n(1 × 2 = 2)\n[16]\nAnswers to activity 4.2 \n1. Fossil fuels and fertilisers release greenhouse gases like  \ncarbon dioxide and methane into the air. 33 These gases  \ntrap heat in the atmosphere. 33 This increases the Earth’s \ntemperature, which leads to changes in Earth’s climate and \nweather. 33 \n(6)\n2. The increase in the Earth’s temperature causes the polar  \nicecaps to melt. 33 This leads to increasing sea levels. 33 \n(4)\n3. It would decrease food security/cause food insecurity. 33 \n(2)\n4. Land would be flooded, so there is less land to use for  \nagriculture or food production. 33 \n(2)\n5. Overfishing33 \n(2)\n[16]"
