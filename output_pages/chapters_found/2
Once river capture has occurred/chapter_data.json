The captured \nriver turns into a misfit stream and a wind gap forms (where water stops flowing \naltogether). An elbow of capture is formed at the point of capture. Sometimes a waterfall \nmay be formed at the elbow of capture. The captor stream is rejuvenated.\nYou may be asked in an exam \nto identify the features of river \ncapture on a diagram or you \nmay be asked to describe \nthe features in detail.
