There are \nthree global wind systems:\n• \nThe tropical easterlies\n• \nThe westerlies\n• \nThe polar easterlies\nA force called Coriolis force causes global winds to move to the left in the \nsouthern hemisphere and to the right in the northern hemisphere.\nThe tri-cellular arrangement, the pressure belts and the global winds \ntogether form the global air circulation. This is shown in Figure 1.1.2 below.\nPolar cell\nPolar high pressure\nPolar easterlies\nWesterlies\nTropical easterlies\nEquatorial low pressure\nTropical easterlies\nWesterlies\nPolar easterlies\nPolar high pressure\nFerrel cell\nHadley cell\nHadley cell\nFerrel cell\nPolar cell\nSubpolar low pressure\nSubtropical high pressure\nIntertropical convergence \nzone\nSubtropical high pressure\nSubpolar low pressure\nFigure 1.1.2: Global air circulation\n1.2 Cyclones\n1.2.1 Mid-latitude cyclones\nIn this section, we look at mid-latitude cyclones in more detail. We  \nwill focus on the cross-section through a mature mid-latitude cyclone \nand the weather that occurs as a result of the cold front. This is the most \nfrequently tested section as South Africa is mostly affected by the passage \nof cold fronts.\nFigure 1.2.1A shows a cross-section through a mid-latitude cyclone. You \nmust be able to label and sketch the cross-section from a synoptic view, as \nshown in Figure 1.2.3A (see page 10, table 1.1).\nLearn to redraw Figure 1.1.2 \nand label it from memory.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams"
