    "D URBAN SETTLEMENT  55\nChapter\n3\n3.3.3 Structure of an urban area\nThe study of an urban area involves focusing on the following three aspects:\n• \nUrban profile\n• \nUrban street patterns\n• \nUrban land use zones\nUrban profile\nAn urban profile is a view of the urban area from the side, like looking at \nthe side view of a person’s face. We call the side view a profile. A profile is \nseen in cross section drawings.\nFigure 3.3.3A below shows a cross section of an urban profile.\nHigh income \nresidential\nSuburban \noffice park\nLow income \nhousing/informal \nsettlement\nTransition zone\nSuburban \nshopping centre\nIndustrial \nzone\nRural urban \nfringe\nCBD\nFigure 3.3.3A: An urban profile\nWhen we study an urban profile we take note of the height, the density of \nthe buildings, and land value. \n• \nLooking at the city from the centre towards the outskirts \nThe height of the buildings decreases the further away you go from \nthe centre of the city. The density (how many buildings there are in \nan area) also decreases the further you go from the city centre. The \nreason for the decrease in density and height is because land value \ndecreases as you move away from the centre of the city.\n• \nLooking at a city from the outskirts towards the centre \nThe height of the buildings increases the closer you get to the city \ncentre. The density of the buildings also increases the closer you get \nto the city centre.\n• \nThinking about land value \nLand value in the centre of the city is very high because it is in high \ndemand (lots of people value it and want to live or work there). The \nland value decreases the further you go from the city centre.  \nThe density and height in the centre of the city is highest because \nof the high land value. People must make maximum use of the land. \nThis is why there are many high-rise buildings in the city centre. \nDue to the high land value in the city centre, certain functions will \nmove to the outskirts of the city, such as factories, businesses and \nresidential (houses). Factories and business are often located in \nspecific areas known as industrial or office parks. Houses are located \nin residential suburbs."
