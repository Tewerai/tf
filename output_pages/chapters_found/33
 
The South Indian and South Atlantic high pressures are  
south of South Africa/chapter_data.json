    "1 CLIMATE AND WEATHER  15\nChapter\n1\n1. Name the high pressure cells labelled A and B. \n(2 × 2 = 4)\n2. Give TWO pieces of evidence from the map that this is  \na summer map. \n(2 × 2 = 4)\n3. Identify the low pressure cell labelled E. \n(1 × 2 = 2)\n4. The letter G indicates a mid-latitude cyclone.\na) Name the fronts labelled F and H. \n(2 × 2 = 4)\nb) In which direction does this cyclone generally move? (1 × 2 = 2)\nc) Describe how front F will affect the weather of  \nCape Town. \n(3 × 2 = 6)\n5. Refer to the cyclone named Cathy.\na) What type of cyclone is Cathy? \n(1 × 2 = 2)\nb) State how many cyclones have occurred for this  \nseason, including Cathy. \n(1 × 2 = 2)\nc) In which direction does this cyclone move? \n(1 × 2 = 2)\nd) List TWO conditions necessary for this cyclone to form. (2 × 2 = 4)\n6. Refer to the weather station labelled D and describe the  \nweather in terms of: cloud cover, wind speed, wind  \ndirection, air temperature, dewpoint temperature. \n(4 × 2 = 8)\n[40]\nAnswers to activity 1\n1.
