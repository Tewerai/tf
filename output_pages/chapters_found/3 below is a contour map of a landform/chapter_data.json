    "ind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography \nCHAPTER 5 MAPWORK  127\nChapter\n5\nFigure 5.3.3 below is a contour map of a landform. If we had to draw a \ncross section from A to B on Figure 5.3.3 we would first imagine we were \nwalking from A to B:\n• \nLooking at the heights on the contours we see we are walking uphill;\n• \nThen we go downhill a little bit;\n• \nThen uphill again; and \n• \nThen downhill to B.\nFigure 5.3.3: A contour map of a landform\nA cross section is drawn on a graph. We use the vertical axis to show the \nheight and horizontal axis to show the distance.\nIf the vertical and horizontal scales are the same, it is not easy to see the \ndifferences in slope.\nFigure 5.3.4 below shows the cross section from A to B (in Figure 5.3.3). \nBecause the vertical and horizontal scales are the same (1:10 000), we do \nnot really get a good idea of the differences in slope.\nFigure 5.3.4: Cross section from A to B (vertical and horizontal scales the same)"
