    "WEATHER \nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n1\nThe ocean currents also affect the temperatures and rainfall:\n• \nThe currents on our east and west coasts have the greatest impact \non South Africa’s climate.\n• \nThe warm Mozambique current flows along our east coast.\n• \nThe cold Benguela current flows along our west coast.\n• \nThe warm Mozambique current causes high temperatures and more \nrain on the east coast.\n• \nThe cold Benguela current causes low temperatures and less rain on \nour west coast.\nBecause of the influence of these currents, temperatures are higher on \nthe east coast than on the west coast. Figure 1.3.1A shows the ocean \ncurrents that affect South Africa’s climate and the resultant minimum \ntemperatures.\n°C\n<7,5\n7,5–10\n10–15\n>15\nBloemfontein\nAgulhas current (warm)\nDurban\nPort Nolloth\nCape Town\nMozambique \ncurrent (warm)\nFigure 1.3.1A: The three ocean currents and their effect on minimum \ntemperatures.\nFigure 1.3.1B shows the ocean currents \nthat affect South Africa’s climate and the \nresultant maximum temperatures. \nFigure 1.3.1C shows the seasons in which \nrainfall is received in South Africa. The black \narrow shows how rainfall decreases from \neast to west across the country mainly due \nto the Mozambique and Benguela currents.\n• The east coast gets rain all year round, \nso it will have a higher rainfall.\n• The west coast is an arid (desert) \nregion so it receives very little rain.\n°C\n<20\n20–22,5\n22,5–27,5\n>27,5\nBloemfontein\nMozambique current (warm)\nAgulhas current (warm)\nBenguela current (cold)\nDurban\nPort Nolloth\nCape Town\nFigure 1.3.1B: The three ocean currents and their effect on \nmaximum temperatures\nBenguela currents \n(cold)\nTo prepare  \nwell for the exam  \nand to understand this  \ntopic better, find out the cause \nof the winter rainfall in the  \nsouth-western \nCape."
