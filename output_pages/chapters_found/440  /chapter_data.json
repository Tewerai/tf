Vertical exaggeration calculations can be done on both \na topographic map and an orthophoto.\nTrue bearing\nTrue bearing is the angle measured clockwise from true north (0°).\nWe calculate true bearing, magnetic declination and magnetic bearing  \nto help us determine in which direction we are going or to help us find  \nour way.\nMethod for measuring the true \nbearing from A to B\nFollow these steps:\nStep 1: Draw a straight line joining A and B.\nStep 2: Draw a north line through A (the point of measurement).\nStep 3: Place the 0 of your protractor at the top of the north line.\nStep 4:  Moving in a clockwise direction from 0, read off where the line \njoining A and B touches the protractor.\nThe true bearing from A to \nB is 138°. (In the exam, a \ndegree either way will be \naccepted, i.e. the answer can \nbe 137° to 139°.)\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nexams"
