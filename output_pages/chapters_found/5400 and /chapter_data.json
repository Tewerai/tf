The gradient \ntells us how steep a straight line is.\nWe calculate gradient to find out how steep or gentle a slope is. \nFormula for gradient\nGradient = \nHeight (vertical) \nDistance (horizontal)\nOR\nG = H\nD\nMethod for calculating gradient \nFollow these steps:\nStep 1:  Calculate the difference in height by subtracting the lowest \nheight from the highest height. The answer must be in metres.\nStep 2: Measure the distance in cm. \nStep 3:  Convert to metres by multiplying by 500 (if you are working \nwith a topographic map) or by 100 (if you are working with an \northophoto).\nStep 4: Write the two answers as a ratio.\nStep 5:  Divide both sides of the ratio by the height. This is so we can get \na ratio of 1 to a relative number, in other words, distance.\nStep 6: Your answer is the gradient written as a ratio.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\n  Worked example\nTopographic map calculation:\nOrthophoto calculation:\nCalculate the gradient between \n·5400 and ·5000\nG = H\n \nD\nH: 5 400 – 5000 = 400 m\nD: 2,2 cm × 500 = 1 100 m\nG: 400:1 100\n   400:400\n= 1:2,75\nCalculate the gradient between \n·"
