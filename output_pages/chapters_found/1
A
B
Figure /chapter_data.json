This can be seen in Figure 1.2.1A (above) as you move over from \npoint 1 to 2.\nFigure 1.2.1B (below) shows the weather conditions before and after the \ncold front.\nIn front of the cold front\nThe cold front\nBehind the cold front\nCumulus\nOvercast\nCumulonimbus\nPartly \ncloudy\nHigh pressure\nCold\nLight rain\nFigure 1.2.1B: Weather conditions before and after the cold front\nVery low pressure\nTo prepare  \nbetter for the exam  \nand understand  this topic \nbetter, read  up on the \nweather associated with the  \nwarm front and  \nwarm sector.\nLearn to  \nredraw Figure 1.2.1A \nand label it. You must be \nable to describe the weather \nthat occurs with a \nmid-latitude  \ncyclone."
