    "Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n5\nThe following table lists some of the symbols you may find on a map:\nSymbol\nWhat it looks like\nWeir\nRepresented as a black line across a river, like a dam wall. It is a barrier or mini dam wall \nwhich slows down the flow of water.\nFurrow and canal\nRepresented as a solid blue line and labelled as furrow or canal. It is used to transport \nwater from source (dam/river) to where it is needed.\nAerodrome\nA small airport\nSlimes dam\nRepresented as a solid black line forming a geometric shape, often rectangular. It stores \nliquid waste from the mining process.\nMine dump\nRepresented as solid lines radiating out from a central point. It is a small mountain-like \nfeature, often yellowish in colour. It consists of solid waste from the mining process.\nRifle range/\nshooting range\nThese are enclosed by a solid black line. This is a place where people practise shooting.\nTable 5.1: Symbols found on maps \nColours are often used to make symbols clearer. There are six colour groups:\nColour\nWhat it is used for\nBrown\nLand or earth features: Contours, eroded areas, prominent rocky outcrops, sandy areas \nand dunes, secondary roads\nBlue\nWater features: Aqueducts, canals, furrows, coastlines, dams, lakes, marshes, swamps \nand vleis, pans, rivers, water-towers. National freeways are also shown in dark blue\nGreen\nVegetation features: Cultivated fields, golf courses, nature and game reserve boundaries, \nstate forest boundaries, orchards and vineyards, recreation grounds, woodland/plantations\nBlack\nConstruction features: Roads, tracks, railways, buildings, bridges, cemeteries, \ncommunication towers, dam walls, excavations and mine dumps, telephone lines, power \nlines, wind pumps, wrecks, ruins, trigonometrical station, boundaries\nGrey\nConstruction features: Built-up areas\nRed\nConstruction features: National, arterial and main roads, lighthouses and marine lights. \nPink also shows international boundaries\nTable 5.2: Colours used on maps \n4. Contour lines on a map show the areaâ€™s relief (the difference in \nelevation) or altitude (height in metres of the land above sea level). \nThe closer together the contour lines are, the steeper the slope is. \nThe lines are labelled so that you read up the slope. \n780\n740\n700\n680\n640\n700\n660\nFigure 5.2.3: Countour lines of a steep slope \nFigure 5.2.4: Contour lines of gentle slope"
