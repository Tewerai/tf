    "xii  INTRODUCTION \nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nMind maps\nThere are several mind maps included in this guide, summarising some of \nthe sections. \nHave a look at the following pictures of a brain cell (neuron) and a  \nmind map:\nFigure 1: Brain cell or neuron\nFigure 2: Mind map rules\nMind maps work because they show information that we have to learn in \nthe same way that our brains ‘see’ information. \nAs you study the mind maps in the guide, add pictures to each of the \nbranches to help you remember the content.\nYou can make your own mind maps as you finish each section. \nHow to make your own mind maps:\n1. Turn your paper sideways so your brain has space to spread out in all \ndirections.\n2. Decide on a name for your mind map that summarises the \ninformation you are going to put on it.\n3.  Write the name in the middle and draw a circle or bubble or picture \naround it.\n4. Write only key words on your branches, not whole sentences. Keep it \nshort and simple.\n5. Each branch should show a different idea. Use a different colour for \neach idea. Connect the information that belongs together. This will \nhelp build your understanding of the learning areas.\n6. Have fun adding pictures wherever you can. It does not matter if you \ncan’t draw well.  \nMind \nmapping  \nyour notes makes \nthem more interesting \nand easier to \nremember."
