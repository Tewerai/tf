    "tment of Basic Education 2014\n122  CHAPTER 5 MAPWORK \nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n5\nUse the following steps\nStep 1:  Write the format for position like this (leaving the blanks for you \nto fill your answer in later).\n_____° ____,___' S\n_____° ____,___' E\nStep 2:  Work out the degrees for latitude and longitude for the map. \nThey are written in the top left-hand corner of the map. Write \nthe degrees down on your format.\n24° ____,___' S\n31° ____,___' E\nStep 3:  Work out the minutes for latitude and longitude. The spot \nheight is in the 10' block for latitude (not the 11' block for \nlatitude) and the 28' block for longitude (not the 29' block for \nlongitude). Write the minutes down in the blank spaces of your \nposition format.\n24° 10',___' S\n31° 28',___' E\nStep 4:  Measure the distance between 10' and 11' and divide it by  \n2. Then make a mark on the line between 10' and 11' where  \n3 cm is. \n240 11'\n310 28'\n310 29'\n240 10'\n501\nStep 5:  Measure the distance between 28' and 29' and divide it by 2. \nMake a mark on the line between 28' and 29' where 4,7 cm is.\nStep 6:  The space between 10' and 11' is divided into 10 decimal \nplaces, in other words, 10,1'; 10,2'; 10,3'; 10,4'; 10,5'; 10,6'; \n10,7'; 10,8' and 10,9'.\nAs the spot height is in the bottom half of the block, we are only \nconcerned with the 10,5’ to 10,9’ part of the block.\nOnce you have divided the block in half, divide the half you are \ninterested in equally with 4 lines. This can be done freehand (without \na ruler), but judge carefully so that the spaces are equal.\nAfter 10,9’ it becomes 11’, so \nyou can never have 10,10’.\nAfter 28,9’ it becomes 29’, so \nyou can never have 28,10’\nAL ATTENTION\nd examples\nNB"
