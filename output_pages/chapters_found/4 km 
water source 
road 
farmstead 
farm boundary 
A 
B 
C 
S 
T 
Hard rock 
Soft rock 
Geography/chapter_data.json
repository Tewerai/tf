The proportion of people living in urban areas \nincreased from 52% in 1990 to 62% in 2011. The share of those living in rural areas \ndropped from 48% to 38% over the same period. \n \nSouth Africa's long-term urbanisation trend is partly the result of freer movement of \npeople after apartheid. Higher economic growth in urban areas has also drawn people \nto cities in search of employment, including immigrants from outside the country. \n \n[Source: www.sairr.org.za/media/media-releases/Urbanisation%2520-%252022_Jan_2013.pdf] \n  \n \n \n \nrural-urban fringe \nsuburbs \ninner city \nA"
