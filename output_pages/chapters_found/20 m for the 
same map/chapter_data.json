    "Education 2014\n128  CHAPTER 5 MAPWORK \nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n5\nTo overcome this problem, we exaggerate (make it more obvious or clear) \nthe profile vertically by using a different vertical scale from the horizontal \nscale. This is shown in Figure 5.3.5.\nFigure 5.3.5 uses a vertical scale where 1 cm represents 20 m for the \nsame map. It is much easier to see the changes in slope along the profile.\nFigure 5.3.5: Cross-section from A to B (vertical and horizontal scales differ)\nWe therefore say the cross-section has been exaggerated, and we need to \ncalculate how many times it has been made steeper or exaggerated. This \nis called the vertical exaggeration.\nFormula to calculate vertical exaggeration\nVertical exaggeration = Vertical scale divided by Horizontal scale\nVE = VS รท HS\nor\nVE = VS\n \nHS\nRemember the \nhorizontal scale lies \nthe same way as  \nthe horizon."
