The sheet reference links one South African map to all the \nmaps of South Africa.\nAn example of a map sheet reference is 3318CD. The digits (numbers) and \nletters have specific meaning:\nThe numbers in the map sheet reference refer to the intersection of the \nlines of latitude and longitude (3318CD). The first two numbers refer to \nlatitude (33) and the last two numbers refer to longitude (18). The letters \nCD refer to the blocks.\nThe area within these lines of latitude and longitude is divided into four \nsquares, labelled A, B, C and D (big blocks).\nEach of the big blocks is then subdivided into four smaller squares, also \nlabelled A, B, C and D (small blocks).\nExample 1\nFor the map title 3318CD Cape Town:\nGive the map sheet reference to the east of 3318CD.\n• \nThe block to the east of 3318CD (light shading) is block C (darker \nshading).\nRemember,  \nlatitude (N or S) \nis always written \nfirst.\nIn the exam, you may be asked two types of questions based on \nthe map sheet reference:\n• Typical question 1: What is the map sheet reference of the map? (You will find the \nanswer at the top of the map in front of the name of the place shown on the map.)\n• Typical question 2: Name the map sheet reference in any direction from the given \nmap sheet reference. (This is explained in Examples 1 and 2 below.)\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams\nRemember,  \nyou will always be given \na South African topographical \nmap, so your latitude will \nalways be South and your \nlongitude will always  \nbe East."
