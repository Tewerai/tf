Changes can occur \nto a river’s longitudinal profile because of two processes:\n• \nRejuvenation: We will focus on the causes of rejuvenation and the \nchanges to the cross profiles of each stage in a river.\n• \nRiver capture: We will focus on the features that occur as a result of \nriver capture.\nRejuvenation\nWhen a river gets more energy it is said to be rejuvenated. It has more \nenergy to erode downwards and laterally (sideways).\nThe causes of river rejuvenation are:\n• \nAn increase in the volume of the river, giving the river more energy.\n• \nA drop in sea level due to uplift of land makes the longitudinal profile \nsteeper, giving the river more energy.\nLet us now look at the changes in the cross profiles of a river due to \nrejuvenation:\n• \nUpper course: The valley becomes steeper and more V-shaped. This \nis shown in Figure 2.2.5B (below right).\nFigure 2.2.5C: A cross profile of a \nriver valley in the middle course after \nrejuvenation has occurred\nFigure 2.2.5D: A cross profile of a river valley in the lower course after \nrejuvenation has occurred\nOldest floodplain\nSecond oldest floodplain\nRiver\nFloodplain terrace \ncovered with silt\nTerrace\nNorth\nSouth\n Middle course: Downward erosion \nresults in a second U-shaped valley \nforming. This results in a valley \nwithin a valley. This is shown in  \nFigure 2.2.5C (above).\n Lower course: Downward and lateral (sideways) erosion cause a \nsecond valley to form. Because floodplains occur in this stage of \na river, the valleys have a step-like (terraced) appearance. This is \nshown in Figure 2.2.5D (above). If meanders occur, they will be \neroded downwards (incised) forming steep-sided meanders."
