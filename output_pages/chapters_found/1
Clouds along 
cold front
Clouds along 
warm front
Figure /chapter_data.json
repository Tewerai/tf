It is accompanied by \nthunderstorms and a circulation of winds near the Earth’s surface, which \nis clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the \nnorthern hemisphere. Tropical cyclones are also known as hurricanes in \nAmerica; typhoons in China and Japan; and willywillies in Australia. Tropical \ncyclones are given names alphabetically within the season in which they \noccured. For example, ‘Alfred’ will denote that it is the first tropical cyclone \nto occur in that season.\nWe will now look at tropical cyclones in more detail by focusing on the \ncross-section through a mature \ntropical cyclone.\nIn order for the tropical cyclone to \noccur there should be:\n•  temperature of 27°C and more\n• Coriolis force\n• enough moisture\n• less function\n Figure 1.2.2A shows a cross-\nsection through a tropical cyclone. \nYou must be able to label and \nsketch the cross-section from a \nsynoptic view as shown in Figure \n1.2.3A (see page 10, table 1.1).\nSubsiding air\nCumulus\nCumulonimbus\nCumulonimbus\nEye\nLow \npressure\nThunderstorms\nA\nB\nFigure 1.2.2A: Cross-section from A to B through a tropical cyclone (from \nsynoptic view in Figure 1.2.3B) (page 10, table 1.1)\nMake \nsure you are able \nto draw Figure \n1.2.2A and label it \ncorrectly."
