You don’t  \nwant to waste valuable time going to the toilet during the exam.\n4. \nUse the 10 minutes reading time to read the instructions  \ncarefully. This helps to ‘open’ the information in your brain.  \nStart with the question you think is the easiest to get the flow \ngoing. In the mapwork exam, use this time to look carefully at the \nwhole map.\n5. \nBreak the questions down to make sure you understand what is \nbeing asked. If you don’t answer the question properly you won’t \nget any marks for it. Look for the key words in the question to  \nknow how to answer it. A list of these words is on page ix of this \nstudy guide.\n6. \nTry all questions. Each question has some easy marks in it so  \nmake sure that you do all the questions in the exam.\n7. \nNever panic, even if the question seems difficult at first. It will be \nlinked with something you have covered. Find the connection. \n8. \nManage your time properly. Don’t waste time on questions you  \nare unsure of. Move on and come back if time allows. \n9. \nCheck weighting – how many marks have been allocated for your \nanswer? Take note of how marks are allocated to the questions \nin this study guide. Do not give more or less information than is \nrequired. \n10. Write big and bold and clearly. You will get more marks if the \nmarker can read your answer clearly. \nIf you can dream it, you can do it. \nWalt Disney\nRemember to  \ntake your calculator \nto your mapwork \nexam!"
