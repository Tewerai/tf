    "raphy\nChapter\n1\nKey concepts\nCONCEPT\nDEFINITION\nAnabatic winds\nWarm winds that blow up a valley slope during the day.\nAnticyclone \n(high pressure)\nForms as a result of sinking air. Air movement is anticlockwise, divergent \n(outwards), subsiding (sinking) in the southern hemisphere, e.g. South Atlantic \nHigh, South Indian High and Kalahari High.\nAspect\nThe direction in which a slope faces.\nBerg winds\nHot, dry winds that blow from the interior of South Africa to coastal areas.\nClimate change\nLong-term changes to the global climate, resulting in unusual and extreme \n(stronger) weather conditions.\nCyclone \n(low pressure)\nForms as a result of rising air. Air movement is clockwise, convergent (inwards), \nrising (convection) in the southern hemisphere, e.g. coastal low, tropical \ncyclone, mid-latitude cyclone.\nHeat island\nHigher temperatures in urban areas than the surrounding rural area. There are \nmany causes of heat island including pollution.\nInversion layer\nZone where sinking cold air meets with the rising warm air. A layer of the \natmosphere in which temperature increases with height.\nInter-tropical convergence \nzone (ITCZ)\nAn area along the equator where the tropical easterlies from both hemispheres \nmeet.\nKatabatic winds\nCold winds that blow down a valley slope at night.\nPolar Easterlies\nWinds that blow from the pole towards subpolar low pressure belts (90° to \n60°).\nTemperature inversion\nTemperature increasing with height.\nThermal belt\nZone of warmer temperature above the valley floor.\nTropical easterlies/trade \nwinds\nWinds that blow from the subtropical high belts towards the equatorial low \npressure belt (0° to 30°).\nWesterlies\nWinds that blow from the subtropical high pressure belts to the subpolar low \npressure belts (30° to 60°).\nIf you know and understand the definitions in this chapter, you will \nbe able to answer most of the questions in the climate and weather \n(climatology) section of the final exam. Use your mobile notes to learn these concepts \nwell (see page x for instructions on how to make them). Adding pictures to your mobile \nnotes will help you remember the concepts.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES boy \nand girl-left and \nright of page\nStep by step\ncomment\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\ncomment\nexams"
