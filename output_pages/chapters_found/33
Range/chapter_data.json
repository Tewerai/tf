Easy access to trade and transport in the area is the reason why \npeople settle there.\nThere are three types of trade and transport cities:\n• \nBreak-of-bulk towns or cities: They develop at a point where the \ntype of transport changes. This is most often at a harbour where the \ntransport changes from sea to land.\n• \nJunction towns or cities: They develop at an intersection of two major \ntransport routes, for example a railway junction.\n• \nGap towns or cities: They develop at a point of access through or \nover a physical barrier, for example at a mountain pass.\nSpecialised towns or cities\nThese are towns or cities which have developed because of one main  \nor dominant function occurring in the area. If the function were to stop \nthen the city would be at risk of becoming a ghost town (a deserted town). \nExamples of specialised towns or cities are:\n• \nMining towns or cities, e.g. Welkom\n• \nEducation towns or cities, e.g. Grahamstown\n• \nIndustrial towns or cities, e.g. Secunda, Sasolburg\n• \nResort towns or cities, e.g. Margate\n• \nDormitory or commuter towns or cities, e.g. Soweto\nIn an exam, you may be asked to identify the type of trade and transport city in a \ndiagram. If a key is given, look at it carefully to help you answer the question.
