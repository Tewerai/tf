    "partment of Basic Education 2014\n118  CHAPTER 5 MAPWORK \nMind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n5\nMethod for calculating magnetic \nbearing\nTo get the true bearing and the magnetic declination we use the same \nmethods applied in 5.3.3A (on page 111) and 5.3.3B (on page 112).\nThese methods are provided again below. Follow these steps:\nStep 1: Measure the true bearing from A to B (as described in 5.1.3A)\nStep 1a: Draw a straight line joining A and B.\nStep 1b: Draw a north line through A (the point of measurement).\nStep 1c: Place the 0 of your protractor at the top of the north line.\nStep 1d: Moving in a clockwise direction from 0, read off where the line \njoining A and B touches the protractor.\nStep 2: Calculate the magnetic declination (as described in 5.1.3B)\nStep 2a: Work out the difference in years between the current year and \nyear given on the map. Your answer must be in years. (Use the \nyear that is printed straight after the words ‘true north’. You can \nignore the month that is shown.)\nStep 2b: Multiply the number of years with the mean annual change (this \nis given on the map) to get the change since the declination \nwas recorded.\nStep 2c: If the mean annual change is eastwards, then you have to \nsubtract the change from the magnetic declination given. If the \nmean annual change is westwards, then you must add it to the \ngiven magnetic declination.\nStep 2d: Your answer is the magnetic declination for the current year. \nMagnetic declination is always west of true north.\nStep 3: Now add the true bearing to the magnetic declination. Your \nanswer must not have a direction (north, south, east or west) \nbecause it is an angle measured only in degrees and minutes.\nExample \nMD = 18°,8 W = 17° 48’ W\nChange in years = 2012 – 1988 = 24 years\nChange since 1989 = 24 × 4’ = 96’ W = 1° 36’ W\nMD = 17° 48’ + 1° 36’ \n \n= 18° 84’ W = 19° 24’ W\nTB = between 299° and 303°\nMB = TB + MD \n \n= 301° + 19° 24’\nMB  = 320° 24’\nAlways write  \nthe formula  \nMB = TB + MD  \nin your calculations \nas this will earn you a \nmark."
