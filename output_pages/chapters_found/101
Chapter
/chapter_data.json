Direction is expressed using the points on a compass – North, South, \nEast and West, and the points between them. These are known as \nthe 16 cardinal points.\nFigure 5.2.1: The 16 cardinal points of a compass\n2. The three main lines of latitude that run across the surface of \nthe Earth are the equator, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of \nCapricorn. The equator is the longest line of latitude (where the \nEarth is widest in an East–West direction). It is located at 0 degrees \nlatitude. The equator divides the planet into the northern and \nsouthern hemispheres. The Tropic of Cancer is located at 231\n3° north \nof the equator. The Tropic of Capricorn lies at 231\n3° south of the \nequator. The Tropic of Capricorn runs through northern South Africa.\nFigure 5.2.2: The three main lines of latitude\n3. Reading a map is as easy as reading a book but, instead of using the \nalphabet, you have to know the conventional signs used in maps. \nThese help you to see the landscape (relief, drainage, vegetation \nand huhuman-made features). Conventional signs are used to show \nparticular features. They may be letters of the alphabet or symbols. \nMany symbols look like the features they represent. \nUse the following mnemonic \nto remember the order of the \ncompass points:\nN – Never \nNorth\nE – Eat \nEast\nS – Silk \nSouth\nW – Worms \nWest\nTROPIC OF CANCER\nEQUATOR\nTROPIC OF CAPRICORN"
