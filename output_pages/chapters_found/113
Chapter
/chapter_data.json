This is found at the North Pole.\n• \nMN is magnetic north. This is the direction in which a compass would \npoint.\n• \nMD is the magnetic declination. It is the angle you are calculating.\n• \n1990.01 refers to the year and the month that the declination was \nrecorded.\n• \n1985–1995 refers to the years the mapmaker used to get the mean \n(average) magnetic declination. You will not need these years.\n• \nMean annual change refers to how much the magnetic declination \nchanges by each year. The change is in minutes (this is shown by the \nsymbol ‘).\n• \nThe declination can change in a westerly (angle increases) or \neasterly (angle decreases) direction.\nMethod for calculating magnetic \ndeclination \nFollow these steps:\nStep 1:  Work out the difference in years between the current year and \nyear given on the map. Your answer must be in years. (Use the \nyear that is printed straight after the words ‘true north’. You can \nignore the month that is shown.)\nStep 2:  Multiply the number of years with the mean annual change (this \nis given on the map) to get the change since the declination was \nrecorded.\nStep 3:  If the mean annual change is eastwards, then you have to \nsubtract the change from the magnetic declination given. If the \nmean annual change is westwards, then you must add it to the \ngiven magnetic declination.\nStep 4:  Your answer is the magnetic declination for the current year. \nMagnetic declination is always west of true north.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nhint\nexams\nE ast means (–) \nminus from left to right.\n(–)\n(–)"
