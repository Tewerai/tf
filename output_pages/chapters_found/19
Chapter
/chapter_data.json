An urban heat island \nis when the city has warmer temperatures than the surrounding rural areas.\nIn the exam, you may be asked how the temperatures change as you move \ntowards the centre of the city. Figure 1.4.3A shows how the temperatures \nincrease the closer you get to the city centre (also called the Central \nBusiness District, or CBD).
