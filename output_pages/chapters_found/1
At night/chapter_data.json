This determines \nwhether the Sun’s rays will hit the side of the valley directly or indirectly \n(obliquely). We will focus on how aspect influences the temperatures of \nnorth- and south-facing slopes in the southern hemisphere.\nIn the exam, you may be \nasked to draw, label or \ndescribe how the thermal belt \nand a frost pocket form in \nvalleys. Learn to redraw and \nlabel Figure 1.4.1C.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nACTIVITIES \nand girl-left\nright of pag\nStep by step\ncomm\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nhint\nactivity\nactivity\nexams"
