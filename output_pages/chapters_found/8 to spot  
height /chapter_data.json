You will need to calculate what the \nmagnetic declination is for the current year.\nYou will find the magnetic declination for the year the map was drawn \non the map. This information appears on a map on the left-hand side or \nat the bottom of the map. You need this information to do the magnetic \ndeclination calculation. Look at the following example:\nAlways remember  \nto move to the right \n(clockwise)."
