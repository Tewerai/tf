    "rade 12 Geography \nAPPENDIX 1  139\nAppendix\nAppendix: \nExemplar exam \npaper\nThe 2014 Geography exams have a new format in line with CAPS. The \nDepartment of Basic Education has offered an example of Geography \nPaper 1 and Paper 2 with marking memoranda.\nUse these exam papers, marking memoranda and maps to help you \nprepare for your exams:\n1. Answer the questions in each of the four exams (one Geography \nTheory and three Geography Mapwork exams). Make sure you have \nenough of a break between each one so that you are not too tired to \nthink properly.\n2. Treat each one as a ‘real’ exam by making sure you have all the \nmaterials you need (pens, pencils, eraser, protractor, compass and \ncalculator). Time yourself so you complete Geography Paper 1 within  \n3 hours; and each of the Geography Paper 2 exams within 1 ½ hours.\n3. This exercise is meant to test your knowledge – so don’t cheat \nyourself by looking up the answers provided in the marking \nmemoranda before you’ve finished each exam.\n4. Use the memoranda to check whether or not your answers are \ncorrect. Note where you have got answers wrong – these are the \nsections of the curriculum that you need to do more work on. Go \nback to your textbooks and to the relevant sections of this study \nguide. Spend time learning the sections for which you got the lowest \nmarks.\n5. Remember: success at Mapwork depends on practise, practise, \npractise, and then more practise! That is why you have been provided \nwith three Mapwork exams (Paper 2). Complete each one of them over \nand over again, until you get most of the questions rights. That way you \nwill fly in your year-end exams!"
