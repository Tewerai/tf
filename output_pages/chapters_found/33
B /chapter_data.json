Study the diagram and \nanswer the questions that follow.\n1. Name the valley winds depicted in A and B. \n(2 × 2 = 4)\n2. State ONE advantage of the wind labelled A. \n(1 × 2 = 2)\n3. Name the layer labelled C. \n(1 × 2 = 2)\n4. Explain how the wind labelled B influences:\na) Farming in the valley \n(2 × 2 = 4)\nb) Industry in the valley \n(2 × 2 = 4)\n[16]\nAnswers to activity 2\n1. A – Anabatic wind/upslope wind33\nB – Katabatic wind/downslope wind/gravity wind33 \n(4)\n2. It can carry pollution out of the valley.33 \n(2)\n3.
