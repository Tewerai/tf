Can they see each other? If they can, we say that there is intervisibility between the \ntwo points. If they cannot see each other, we say that there is no intervisibility between the two points.\nMethod to determine intervisibility \nTo work out whether two places are intervisible, follow \nthese steps:\nStep 1: Draw a line joining the points between the two places.\nStep 2:  Look to see if the line you have drawn cuts through any part of the \ncross section. If it does cut through, then there is no intervisibility \nbetween the two points. If it does not cut through, then there is \nintervisibility between the two points.\nIn the exam, you may be \ngiven a cross section and \nasked to determine if two \nplaces are intervisible.\nPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION\nEG - worked examples\nHINT!\ne.g.\nNB\nhint\nexams"
