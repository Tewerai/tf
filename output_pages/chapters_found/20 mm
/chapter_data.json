A hydrograph records how quickly the water level increases \n(time) and how high the water level reaches (peak flow discharge). \nA flow hydrograph combines two graphs:\n• \nA bar graph showing the amount of precipitation\n• \nA line graph showing how the water level increases and decreases \nover time\nFigure 2.2.1B below shows an example of a flow hydrograph. Study the \ngraph and then read the explanation alongside.\nExplanation of the elements in Figure 2.2.2B(left):\n1. The line graph shows the volume of the river over \ntime. The horizontal axis shows time in hours and \nthe vertical axis shows runoff in cubic metres per \nsecond (m3/sec).\n2. The rising segment shows the rate at which \nthe water in the river is increasing. It is steep if \ninfiltration is rapid. It is gentle if infiltration is slow \nas water takes longer to reach the river.\n• Urban areas have a rapid rising segment as \nthe water reaches the river quickly.\n• Naturally vegetated areas allow for \ninfiltration and the rising segment is less \nsteep.\n3. The falling segment shows the rate at which the \nwater in the river is decreasing. It may be less \nsteep than the rising segment.\n• In urban areas the segment falls rapidly as \nless water has been added as base flow due \nto lower infiltration.\n• Natural areas show a slower decrease due to \nadded base flow from infiltrated water.\n4. The bar graph shows the amount of rainfall \n(precipitation) that occurs in the drainage basin \nover time. This is shown on the vertical axis in \nmillimetres (mm).\n5. Time lag (also called lag time) is the time that \nit takes from the heaviest rainfall to the fullest \namount of water in the river (peak flow). It is \ncalculated by establishing the time difference \nbetween the heaviest rainfall and the peak flow of \nthe river.\n6. Base flow is the groundwater contribution to the \ndischarge of a river.\n7. The highest point on the line graph is the peak \nflow discharge. This is when the river reaches its \nhighest volume.\nRunoff (cubic metres per second) →\n7 \nTime (hours/days) →\nFigure 2.2.1B: The different parts of a flow hydrograph\n5 \n2\n3 \n4 \n1\n6 \n50 mm\n40 mm\n30 mm\n20 mm\n10 mm\nRainfall (in millimetres)\nThis section  \n- River discharge, is from \nGrade 10.
