Some of the basic \nideas are included in the list below:\n• \nBefore you can implement a solution, it is important to speak to the \nlocal people and get their ideas on how to improve the area.\n• \nSolutions should look to use the skills and talents of the local  \npeople.\n• \nBasic needs (food, shelter, clothing and clean running water)  \nmust be satisfied before other development can happen.\n• \nImprove services (like electricity and roads) and facilities (like \nhospitals and schools) to encourage people to stay in the area.\n• \nWhen providing for these basic needs, such as building roads or \nclinics, use local labour and train people so they can use their  \nnew skill or trade to earn a living in the area.\n• \nImprove food security by educating farmers in the use of better \nfarming methods, tools and seeds.\n• \nAttract secondary activities, like factories, to rural areas. Encourage \nthese industries to use local raw materials and skills to ensure  \nrural people are employed.\nRural depopulation does not only affect rural areas but also small  \ntowns. Many people are leaving small towns to move to the big cities. Below \nare some basic ideas to consider when improving small towns:\n• \nImprove roads to and from the small town.\n• \nUpgrade facilities in the small town.\n• \nTown councils must find ways to advertise their town to attract \ntourists or people to come and live there, for example:\n– \nBuild old age homes and offer services specifically for older \npeople. This would attract older people to retire to the  \nsmall town.\n– \nDevelop a holiday resort, or attract people for weekend  \ngetaways to the small town."
