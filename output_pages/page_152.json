        "Mind the Gap CAPS Grade 12 Geography\nChapter\n5\nExample 1\nIn Figure 5.3.6 below, is point Q intervisible from point P?\nVertical scale\n1 cm = 20 m\nHorizontal scale 1:10 000\nFigure 5.3.6: Determining intervisibility between points P and Q \nThe answer is that there is no intervisibility between P and Q, as the  \nline cuts through the cross-section (goes through the mountain). This \nmeans you cannot see point Q from point P, and you cannot see point P \nfrom point Q.\nExample 2\nIn Figure 5.3.7 below, is point X intervisible from point Q?\nVertical scale\n1 cm = 20 m\nHorizontal scale 1:10 000\nFigure 5.3.7: Determining intervisibility between points X and Q \nThe answer is there is intervisibility between X and Q, as the line does not \ncut through the cross-section. This means you can see point X from point \nQ, and you can see point Q from point X.\n Activity 5.8\nRefer to the topographical map and orthophoto of Nelspruit at the back of \nthis study guide to answer the following questions:\n1. Calculate the area covered by block B3 on the Nelspruit \ntopographical map in kilometres squared. \n(5)\n2. Calculate the magnetic bearing for 2012 from trig. beacon  \n101 (C3) to spot height 676 (C4) on the topographical map.  \nShow all steps followed (calculations).
