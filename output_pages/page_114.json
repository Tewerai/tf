See if there is \nanything that does not fit the relationship between the factors. In other \nwords, if the relationship shown is that one factor increases and all the \nother factors except for one factor decrease, we will have something to \nsay about the exception. For example, on a graph it could be shown that \nthe contribution of primary economic activities increased production \nover time, except for mining whose production decreased.\nStep 6: Now read the questions set. Circle the question word to \nunderstand what is asked. Set about answering the questions. You will \nfind the answers by reading the information in the graph.\nExample of a bar graph\nCarefully study the bar graph in Figure 4.5.1A below which shows the \ncontribution of different economic sectors to South Africaâs GDP (Gross \nDomestic Product).\nFigure 4.5.1A: Example of a bar graph\nFollow these steps to read the \ngraph\n1. The heading â the graph shows GDP (factor 1) in relation to \ndifferent industries (factor 2), and time (factor 3).\n2. The axes â the vertical axis shows factor 1 (the GDP). The horizontal \naxis shows factor 2 (different industries) and factor 3 (time). \n3. Units of measurement â on the vertical axis factor 1 (GDP) is \nshown as a percentage of total GDP. The horizontal axis lists factor \n2 (industries) by name and factor 3 (time) in years.\n4. Look at whether the GDP trend goes up or down from 1995 to \n2002 in each industry. For example, manufacturing goes down \nfrom 1995 to 2002. The amount it decreases is calculated by \nsubtracting the lower amount from the higher amount: 21,2% â \n20,2% = 1%.\n5. Look at what is unusual â the contribution of finance and transport \nis much higher in 2002.\n6. Now read the questions in activity 4.5 on page 95.\nLet us apply  \nthese steps by looking  \nat specific examples  \nin Figure 4.5.1A  \n(right) and 4.5.1.B  \non page 95."
